  how to recognize?

there's only one class of program that i can think of that we're really missing (which doesn't mean there aren't lots more i'll use when someone invents them), and that's something along the lines of the GNOME Dashboard (nothing to do with Apple's). i made a start in 2002 on a thing i called KnowAll, but it's hampered by lack of a suitable API to monitor, for example, what i'm typing in Mail right now. which is why there are special-case hacks like Terminator's number base convertor and Edit's Java/Ruby/man page advisors. really, i ought to be able to type 3,405,691,582 here and have KnowAll say 0xcafebabe as i do. or FileDescriptor and have a link to the JavaDoc immediately available. despite the fact that i'm in my mailer rather than my editor.

i think GNOME Dashboard got too tied up in crap that wasn't any use (or maybe they just use their computers for very different things than i do), and as far as i can tell is mainly dormant now. there's also the emacs Remembrance Agent, but that seems to have been too early; there wasn't as much useful stuff on the web in those days, and screens were small (and it's crippled by being emacs-specific). as far as i can tell, emacs RA is basically poor man's Spotlight (except as you type in emacs rather than the Spotlight dialog).

what do i waste my time on?

programming reference material: javadoc/ri/man pages, et cetera.

converting bases/recognizing ASCII in numbers.

information about movies/actors: IMDb. car points out that the raw IMDb data is available for download:

information about cinemas: if i'm writing "Four Brothers" in Mail, show me the times it's on at my favorite cinema so i can paste it in.

weather.

public transport.

"google". (NSTextView now has a default "Search in Google" on its pop-up menu, and i've added something similar to salma-hayek's PTextArea. but i'm not always using NSTextView or PTextArea.)

contact information, given a name. also reverse lookup (do i know +1 408 555-1234?).

units conversion. what's 5'3"? how heavy is 140 lbs? what's Â¥80,000? (i tried to solve this with a web proxy, and i see there's a GreaseMonkey script, but the fact is that bad units don't always come from the web.)

dictionary and wikipedia lookup.

the hard part, i think, is that there are several different interfaces here:

weather, for example, i usually just want San Jose weather. but sometimes i want the weather of a place i'm going, or where someone else is. so i'd either just want an easily-available button, or a text field. (i've long said weather belongs in the calendar, but though GNOME thinks the same, Apple doesn't.)

converting bases, for example, i'm almost always looking at the number. i'd probably want to point/select/copy to clipboard the number.

javadoc, for example, i'm almost always just typing FileDescriptor or arraycopy, and i want the computer to have been paying attention.

buttons, text fields, and clipboard monitoring: they're easily done. but they're not what would make this really cool. i assume we could use some sort of accessibility API to read text as it's written, but that's going to need re-doing for each platform, and i've no idea how any of that stuff works. (the Java accessibility stuff doesn't seem to be meant for building accessibility tools so much as making applications accessible.)

"2m is approximately 0 times the length of the River Nile".

impressive.

in fact, playing with it for about a minute, i failed to have it come up with anything i have a good idea of the length or height of, and i wasn't impressed by its choice of strange multiples.

when i followed the link, i had that sinking feeling of someone having implemented my idea (compositing same-scale maps of two towns to give you an idea of their relative size; the idea being that one of the towns is somewhere you choose because you know it well). and when that passed, i had the disappointment of a really lame implementation of a not obviously good idea.

surely, to be successful, such a thing *has* to use pictures? and has to be tailored to stuff you know, so no "Nelson's column", "River Nile", and the like (for me).

interesting that it featured on BBC *radio* rather than TV. i'm sure it didn't come across so badly on radio, because it's no worse than what you usually get. on TV it would have been obvious that it was a poor use of a visual medium.

we're monkeys, damn it! with monkey brains!

SMP never made math any easier by using a picture of a bunny instead of 'x' and a picture of a cake instead of 'y'. all they did was piss me off by insulting me, the cretins.

[don't get me wrong; this was still interesting as an example of how to fuck up the basic idea, so ta for that!]

i realize there's a deeper question of whether it makes any sense to say Texas is twice the size of Germany (because who has a solid understanding of how large Germany really is, and who of those people can "double it"?), but i'd like to see the basic problem solved.

choosing the benchmarks is hard, though.

length:
1cm..4m - comparisons with the human body?
10m..2km - distance from your doorstep?
2km..500km - distances to other cities?
500km..3000km - distances to other countries?
give up?

and what question are you trying to answer: "how much is that?" or "how does x compare to y?" the latter's easily done by compositing two equal-scale pictures (ignoring the likes of "how does the thickness of my fingernail compare to the distance to Venus", which i don't believe a human can understand). but the former's quite personal. taking weight, say, anything heavier than 70kg is pretty much meaningless to me. that's all "infinitely heavy". i could probably recognize a difference by trying to lift heavier objects, but i have so little experience of that that it's bogus, and it won't extend beyond, say, 200kg.

so faced with "how much does Safeways weigh?" we can answer the easier "how many rhinos does Safeways weigh?" -- though compositing arbitrary herds of rhinos might be tricky ;-)  --but i can't get much of an idea of anything that's outside my normal experience.
