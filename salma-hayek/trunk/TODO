Items to be done for PTextArea:

* Cope with insets. We're rendering text too close to the edge.

* Some way to monitor the undo manager, so we can clear the dirty flag in Edit. (And have the Undo/Redo menu items enable/disable themselves?)

* Compound edit support.

* Compounding adjacent edits?

* Create a language-specific API to work out double-click selections, and use this in the mouse handler.

* Refactor the way split lines are updated to work in terms of PLineSegments.

* Style C/C++ pre-processor tokens specially.

* Auto-scroll on selection (all types) flickers more than I think it should.

* martind reports a wrapping bug ("Breaking a wrapped line by pressing Enter in the middle of a line causes the second half of the line to be unwrapped until a resize rewraps it."); remove the newline before "^this sort of" above, then hit return. The long line is no longer wrapped. Resizing or editing within the line cause re-wrapping.

* the following JTextArea methods are thread-safe: append, insert, replace, and setText.

* we can perhaps take Ed's old suggestion for how menus should work into account, and have a constructive scheme, rather than a replacement scheme. (so there's basic stuff offered by the component, extra stuff from the spelling checker, extra stuff from the application, et cetera. Cocoa has hooks for random other bits of code to declare they have actions too.)

* Double-clicking in whitespace behaves neither like native components, nor like Edit used to. In particular, I'm used to double-clicking past the end of a line that doesn't end in '{' to select the line (an Edit/acme thing).
