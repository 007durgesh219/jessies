Items to be done for PTextArea:

* Cope with insets. We're rendering text too close to the edge.

* Use the UIManager's text color, rather than black.

* Some way to monitor the undo manager, so we can clear the dirty flag in Edit. (And have the Undo/Redo menu items enable/disable themselves?)

* Compound edit support.

* Compounding adjacent edits?

* Create a language-specific API to work out double-click selections, and use this in the mouse handler.

* Refactor the way split lines are updated to work in terms of PLineSegments.
