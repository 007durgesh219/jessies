Items to be done for PTextArea:

* Move to next/previous word.

* Check that unclaimed keystrokes are passed on to a JMenuBar.

* Remember user-set horizontal caret position so we can move over short lines and come back to the right column. (Should it work on column, or pixels?)

* Create a language-specific API to work out double-click selections, and use this in the mouse handler.
