<h1>Cygwin Problems</h1>

<h2>Double-clicking on the shortcut icon does nothing</h2>

<p>If you're having trouble starting one of our programs, you may want to try running it from a Cygwin Bash prompt
instead of from the desktop shortcut icon until you work out what's wrong.
Running it manually will use <tt>ruby.exe</tt> rather than the <tt>rubyw.exe</tt> used by the shortcut.
<tt>rubyw.exe</tt> is a version of Ruby linked with <tt>--subsystem windows</tt> instead of <tt>--subsystem console</tt>.
<tt>rubyw.exe</tt> quits with no visible error if it tries to do standard I/O.
One reason why Ruby might try to write to the standard error stream is if it wants to warn about <a href="../salma-hayek/cygwin-setup.html">world-writable directories on the PATH</a>.
If the problem turns out to be anything other than that, please mail us a bug report including the output when you start the program from a Cygwin Bash prompt.
(The web page for the particular project you're trying to run should tell you the email address.)

<p>Any console output from our applications (as opposed to the start-up scripts or their interpreters) is recorded in a file.
For Terminator, these are stored in <tt>~/.terminal-logs/</tt> along with a file containing a log of each tab's output.
Evergreen's output is logged in your temporary directory.
SCM's output is not currently logged.

<h2>Installing Ruby for Windows breaks Ruby for Cygwin</h2>

<p>Another problem we've seen a few times relates to the native Windows port of Ruby.
We don't work with the current stable version, 1.8, because its "pathname.rb" library is broken for Windows paths.
Ruby 1.9 fixes this, but is unlikely to be officially released before 2007-12.
In the meantime we require the Cygwin port of Ruby.

<p>If at any time you install the native Windows Ruby, its installer sets the Windows environment variable RUBYOPT to "-rubygems".
(You can tell it not to do this, but it doesn't make it clear that the default option will break other Ruby interpreters.)
Cygwin's Ruby doesn't include RubyGems (it isn't part of the standard Ruby distribution), which causes it to fail to start with:
<pre>
ruby: no such file to load -- ubygems (LoadError)
</pre>

<p>The fix we've been recommending is to delete the Windows RUBYOPT environment variable.
An alternative is to install RubyGems for your Cygwin Ruby.
Another alternative is to put an empty "ubygems.rb" file somewhere on your Cygwin Ruby's library search path.

<h2>Why do we use Cygwin?</h2>

<p>The main reason for using Cygwin is that one of our projects, Terminator, requires it.
NT's built-in POSIX subsystem won't let you launch native Windows applications or interact with the network, so that wasn't an option.
Cygwin, on the other hand, even contains the Unix98 pseudo-terminal support which we use to support terminal resizing, not to mention containing a port of one of the most widely used ssh programs.

<p>Cygwin is also convenient for us in that it lets us use the same start-up scripts that we use on Linux and Mac OS.

<p>In future, the other projects may be runnable without Cygwin, though probably not before there's a native (non-Cygwin) Ruby 1.9 available.
Even then, if you're doing the kind of work on Windows that would make our tools (which are aimed squarely at programmers and sys admins), installing and learning Cygwin would probably be an excellent investment of your time.
