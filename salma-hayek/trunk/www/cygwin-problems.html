<h1>Cygwin Problems</h1>

<h2>Double-clicking on the shortcut icon does nothing</h2>

<p>If you're having trouble starting one of our programs, please try running it from a Cygwin Bash prompt
instead of from the desktop shortcut icon until you work out what's wrong.
We have had several of these problems in the past.

<p>Please mail us a bug report including the output when you start the program from a Cygwin Bash prompt.
(The web page for the particular project you're trying to run should tell you the email address.)

<p>Any console output from our applications (as opposed to the start-up scripts or their interpreters) is recorded in a file.
For Terminator, these are stored in <tt>~/.terminator/logs/</tt> along with a file containing a log of each tab's output.
Evergreen's output is logged in your temporary directory.
SCM's output is not currently logged.

<h2>Why do we use Cygwin?</h2>

<p>The main reason for using Cygwin is that one of our projects, Terminator, requires it.
NT's built-in POSIX subsystem won't let you launch native Windows applications or interact with the network, so that wasn't an option.
Cygwin, on the other hand, even contains the Unix98 pseudo-terminal support which we use to support terminal resizing, not to mention containing a port of one of the most widely used ssh programs.

<p>Cygwin is also convenient for us in that it lets us use the same start-up scripts that we use on Linux and Mac OS.

<p>In future, the other projects may be runnable without Cygwin, though probably not before there's a native (non-Cygwin) Ruby 1.9 available.
Even then, if you're programming or doing system administration on Windows, installing and learning Cygwin would probably be an excellent investment of your time.

<h2>Why does ls(1) not show me Chinese characters?</h2>

<p>All our projects are designed to work with UTF-8.  Cygwin itself isn't yet.  You can happily edit files containing UTF-8 text but any time you need to deal with a non-ASCII filename, you will have problems.  The Windows NT line uses UTF-16 internally but the older Windows line didn't support Unicode at all, so it would be difficult for Cygwin to use the UTF-16 interfaces without dropping support for Windows 95, 98 and ME.  That is indeed scheduled to happen.

<p>In the meantime, Suzuki Hisao maintains <a href="http://www.okisoft.co.jp/esc/utf8-cygwin/">a web page</a> for his ambitious patch to add UTF-8 support to the current Cygwin source.  The Cygwin maintainers didn't like the approach he took.  If you try his version, please let us know how you get on.
