<h2>What?</h2>

<p>I needed a name for a repository containing useful Java classes shared
by several projects. I couldn't think of a good name, so I went for a nice
name instead.

<p>This page is just a placeholder.

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The distribution is here (<a href="salma-hayek.tgz">salma-hayek.tgz</a>).

<p>The distribution only usually contains binaries for Linux.
We also have binaries for
<a href="salma-hayek-Cygwin.tgz">Cygwin</a>
and <a href="salma-hayek-Darwin.tgz">Mac OS X</a>.

<p>The <a href="ChangeLog.html">ChangeLog</a> is available separately.
