<h2>Downloads</h2>

<h3>Linux (x86)</h3>
<p>For Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions, there's <a href="<!--#echo var="LONG_DIST_NAME"-->.deb"><!--#echo var="LONG_DIST_NAME"-->.deb</a> which will add <!--#echo var="HUMAN_NAME" --> to your GNOME applications menu. (For command-line or non-GNOME users, there's /usr/bin/<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.)

<p>For Fedora and other RPM-based Linux distributions, there's <a href="<!--#echo var="LONG_DIST_NAME"-->.rpm"><!--#echo var="LONG_DIST_NAME"-->.rpm</a>, which is equivalent to the Debian package.

<p>Note that we currently only have packages for the x86 (i386) architecture. For any other architecture, including x86_64 (amd64), you'll have to build from source.

<h3>Mac OS (Intel and PowerPC)</h3>
<p>For Mac OS 10.4, there's <a href="<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.dmg"><!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.dmg</a> which contains a universal binary application that you can simply drag and drop to install.

<h3>MS&nbsp;Windows</h3>
<p>For Windows, there's a Windows installer <a href="<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.msi"><!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.msi</a> which requires that you've already installed Cygwin, including Ruby, yourself but is otherwise complete and leaves you with an icon on your desktop.

<p>We have more information about <a href="/salma-hayek/cygwin-setup.html">setting up Cygwin</a>.

<p>(Why do we need Cygwin? Mainly for Terminator's benefit. NT's built-in POSIX subsystem won't let you launch native Windows applications or interact with the network, so that wasn't an option. Cygwin, on the other hand, even contains the Unix98 pseudo-terminal support which we use to support terminal resizing, not to mention containing a port of one of the most widely used ssh programs.)

<h3>Other Platforms/Architectures</h3>
<p>If no pre-built <!--#echo var="HUMAN_NAME" --> package is available for your platform, see <a href="#building-from-source">Building from source</a> on this page.

<p>The <a href="ChangeLog.html"><!--#echo var="HUMAN_NAME" --> ChangeLog</a> is available separately.

<h2>Building from source</h2>
</a>

<p>There's a source distribution (<a href="<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.tar.gz"><!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.tar.gz</a>),
and you'll also need the source to the library it uses (<a href="../salma-hayek/salma-hayek.tar.gz">salma-hayek.tar.gz</a>).

<p>The <a href="../salma-hayek/index.html#building-from-source">hints for building</a> are the same for all our projects.

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p>We're working on a proper public bug database, but at the moment, you should use "Report a Bug" from the application's "Help" menu if you're able.

<p>If you're not able (because you're having trouble starting the application, for example), mail us at
<tt><script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"<n uers=\"znvygb:fbsgjner\100wrffvrf\056bet\">fbsgjner\100wrffvrf\056bet<\057n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c) { return String.fromCharCode((c <= "Z" ? 90 : 122) >= (c = c.charCodeAt(0) + 13) ? c : c - 26); }));
</script></tt>.

<h3>Writing a good bug report</h3>
<p>Remember to tell us the application (and version), the OS (and version), the architecture (x86, x86-64, PowerPC) &mdash; the "Report a Bug" menu item automatically encodes all this information in the subject line.

<p>A good bug report usually answers these questions: what did you do? What happened? What did you expect would happen? If you know how to make this happen every time, give us the exact steps; we might not be able to guess. You might also want to justify your expectation by telling us which different application or earlier version of our application does what you expected.
