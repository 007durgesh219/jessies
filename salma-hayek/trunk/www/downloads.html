<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>The <a href="ChangeLog.html"><!--#echo var="HUMAN_NAME" --> ChangeLog</a> is available separately.

<h3>Linux (x86)</h3>
<p>For Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions, there are .deb files for <a href="/downloads/debian/<!--#echo var="LONG_DIST_NAME"-->.i386.deb">x86 (i386)</a> and <a href="/downloads/debian/<!--#echo var="LONG_DIST_NAME"-->.amd64.deb">x86_64 (amd64)</a> which will add <!--#echo var="HUMAN_NAME" --> to your GNOME applications menu. (For command-line or non-GNOME users, there's /usr/bin/<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.)

<p>For Fedora and other RPM-based Linux distributions, there are .rpm files for <a href="/downloads/redhat/<!--#echo var="LONG_DIST_NAME"-->.i386.rpm">x86 (i386)</a> and <a href="/downloads/redhat/<!--#echo var="LONG_DIST_NAME"-->.x86_64.rpm">x86_64 (amd64)</a>, which is equivalent to the Debian package.

<h3>Mac OS (Intel and PowerPC)</h3>
<p>For Mac OS 10.4, there's <a href="/downloads/mac/<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.dmg"><!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.dmg</a> which contains a universal binary application that you can simply drag and drop to install.

<h3>MS&nbsp;Windows</h3>
<p>For Windows, there's a Windows installer, <a href="/downloads/windows/<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.msi"><!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.msi</a>, which requires that you've already installed Cygwin, including Ruby, yourself but is otherwise complete and leaves you with an icon on your desktop.

<p>We have more information about <a href="/salma-hayek/cygwin-setup.html">setting up Cygwin</a> if you're not already using it, and <a href="/salma-hayek/cygwin-problems.html">common Cygwin/Ruby problems</a>.

<h3>Solaris (x86)</h3>
<p>For Solaris, there's a package called <a href="/downloads/sunos/SJO<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.i86pc.pkg">SJO<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.i86pc.pkg</a> for installation with <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kqbm?a=view">pkgadd(1M)</a>. This will add <!--#echo var="HUMAN_NAME" --> to your GNOME applications menu. (For command-line or non-GNOME users, there's /usr/bin/<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.)</p>

<h3>Other Platforms/Architectures / Building from Source</h3>
<p>If no pre-built <!--#echo var="HUMAN_NAME" --> package is available for your platform, or you just like building from source, there's a source distribution (<a href="<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.tar.gz"><!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->.tar.gz</a>).
You'll also need the source to the library it uses (<a href="../salma-hayek/salma-hayek.tar.gz">salma-hayek.tar.gz</a>), and you'll need to unpack them such that you can switch from the project to salma-hayek with "cd ../salma-hayek" in the project's root.

<p>Anonymous read-only Subversion access is available with:
<pre>
mkdir software.jessies.org
cd software.jessies.org
svn checkout http://software.jessies.org/svn/<!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->/trunk/ <!--#echo var="SHORT_DIST_NAME"-->
svn checkout http://software.jessies.org/svn/salma-hayek/trunk/ salma-hayek
# You may want to add something like this to your crontab:
#00 23 * * * echo ~/software.jessies.org/salma-hayek/bin/nightly-build.rb ~/software.jessies.org clean build | bash --login
</pre>

<p>The <a href="../salma-hayek/index.html#building-from-source">hints for building</a> are the same for all our projects.

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p>We're working on a proper public bug database, but at the moment, you should use "Report a Bug" from the application's "Help" menu if you're able.

<p>If you're not able (because you're having trouble starting the application, for example), mail our mailing list at
<script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"<n uers=\"znvygb:fbsgjner\100wrffvrf\056bet\">fbsgjner\100wrffvrf\056bet<\057n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c) { return String.fromCharCode((c <= "Z" ? 90 : 122) >= (c = c.charCodeAt(0) + 13) ? c : c - 26); }));
</script><noscript>the address you'll see right here if you enable JavaScript in your browser and reload this page</noscript>.  You'll get an automated reply telling you that your message is awaiting moderation.  Once a moderator verifies that you're not a spambot, you'll be added to the whitelist and subsequent mails won't be delayed.

<h3>Writing a good bug report</h3>
<p>Remember to tell us the application (and version), the OS (and version), the architecture (x86, x86-64, PowerPC) &mdash; the "Report a Bug" menu item automatically encodes all this information in the subject line.

<p>A good bug report usually answers all of the following questions: What did you do? What happened? What did you expect would happen? If you know how to make this happen every time, give us the exact steps; we might not be able to guess. You might also want to justify your expectation by telling us which different application or earlier version of our application does what you expected. Screenshots are often a big help when something looks wrong.
