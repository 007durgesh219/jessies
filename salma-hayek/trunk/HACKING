Use international English spelling.

Use 4-space 'tabs' and K&R (Sun Java) indentation. (That is, follow
the rest of the code.)

Use the Log class instead of System.err/System.out; those should be
used only while debugging.

No new file formats. We can't keep just inventing random formats
left, right and center. Any file we write (for our own purposes) should
use an existing well-known format. It's not acceptable to use
one of Evergreen's existing formats; they should be considered deprecated.

Never use "new File"; use FileUtilities.fileFromString instead; this
also understands ~/HACKING and ~elliotth/HACKING.
