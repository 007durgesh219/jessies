* Use international English spelling.

* Use 4-space 'tabs' and K&R (Sun Java) indentation. (That is, follow
  the rest of the code.)

* Use the Log class instead of System.err/System.out; those should be
  used only while debugging.

* Never use "new File"; use FileUtilities.fileFromString instead; this
  also understands ~/HACKING and ~elliotth/HACKING.
