README file for Terminator, v0.9.

Please do read this file first - it's short, but important.

Terminator has its own terminfo file.  You'll need to install this in order
for Terminator to work correctly.  For information on how to do this, read
the doc/README file.

In order to get the best out of Terminator, you're also recommended to
create a ~/.terminator configuration file in order to enable hyperlinks.
You can copy a pre-written one from doc/pros-examples/, where
there are several for various different operating systems.  If you don't
see your system listed, copy the nearest match and have a quick look
through to make sure it's going to be running the right commands.

Terminator is a joint project between Phil Norman and Elliott Hughes.
Started on 21st April 2004 after Elliott moaned about the lack of a really
good terminal emulator, it's developed over the period of 1 month to
a state where we can happily release version 0.9.

Version 1.0 will follow shortly, after we've tidied up some stuff, and
added a menu so people don't have to hunt too much for the hotkeys.


Feature List:

1: Hyperlink recognition (configurable), allowing arbitrary programs to
be run when a recognised hyperlink is clicked on.

2: Multiple tabs, so you can have several terminals hidden under tabs
within the same window.

3: No line wrap, so reading a catted file is made a lot easier.

4: Proper handling of tabs, so copy/pasting them into other applications
doesn't turn them into strings of spaces.

5: Fully-functioning terminal emulation.


If you find any bugs, please report them to cuvy.abezna@virgin.net
(Phil Norman).
