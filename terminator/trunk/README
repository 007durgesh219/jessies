README file for Terminator, v0.9.

Please do read this file first - it's short, but important.

Terminator has its own terminfo file.  This will be installed in your home
directory unless you run terminator with privileges on the system-wide
terminfo directory.  If it's only installed in your home directory then you
will see "terminal is not fully functional" problems when using su to
switch to another user (although sudo works fine).  Similarly, if you're
using Terminator to run ssh, then you will want to follow the instructions
in doc/README to install the terminfo file on the target system.

In order to get the best out of Terminator, you're also recommended to
customize the ~/.terminator configuration file to enable hyperlinks.
Terminator will attempt to guess appropriate defaults when it's first run.
If you run Terminator on multiple windowing environments with the same
home directory then, er, we apologize.

Terminator is a joint project between Phil Norman and Elliott Hughes.
Started on 21st April 2004 after Elliott moaned about the lack of a really
good terminal emulator, it's developed over the period of 1 month to
a state where we can happily release version 0.9.

Version 1.0 will follow shortly, after we've tidied up some stuff, and
added a menu so people don't have to hunt too much for the hotkeys.


Feature List:

1: Hyperlink recognition (configurable), allowing arbitrary programs to
be run when a recognised hyperlink is clicked on.

2: Multiple tabs, so you can have several terminals hidden under tabs
within the same window.

3: No line wrap, so reading a catted file is made a lot easier.

4: Proper handling of tabs, so copy/pasting them into other applications
doesn't turn them into strings of spaces.

5: Fully-functioning terminal emulation.


If you find any bugs, please report them to cuvy.abezna@virgin.net
