README file for Terminator

Please do read this file first - it's short, but important.

Terminator has its own terminfo file.  This will be installed in your home
directory unless you run terminator with privileges on the system-wide
terminfo directory.  If it's only installed in your home directory then you
will see "terminal is not fully functional" problems when using su to
switch to another user (although sudo works fine).  Similarly, if you're
using Terminator to run ssh, then you will want to follow the instructions
in doc/README to install the terminfo file on the target system.

Terminator will attempt to guess appropriate defaults when it's first run.
If you run Terminator on multiple windowing environments with the same
home directory then hopefully you want the same settings on all of them.

Send bug reports to software@jessies.org, being sure to include the
word "Terminator" in your Subject: line.
