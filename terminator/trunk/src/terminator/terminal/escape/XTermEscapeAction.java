/**
An XTermEscapeAction performs the action associated with an XTerm-style escape sequence.
XTerm escape sequences always start with a ']' character, followed by a number.  Optionally,
following the number is a ';' character, which if present, denotes that following must be some
string of characters terminated by a BEL (0x07) character.  We strip off the initial ']' and the
BEL terminator, if present, in the constructor, since it contains no information.
