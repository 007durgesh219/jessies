<h1>Terminator</h1>

<p><strong>Terminator is a GPL Unix terminal emulator with advanced features not
yet found elsewhere, replacing xterm, rxvt, xwsh and friends on X11 systems,
and Terminal.app on Mac OS X.</strong>

<p>Terminator will run on any Unix with Java 1.4 or later and a C++ compiler.

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Here are some of the features unique to Terminator, or which are rare amongst the competition:

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Find</strong> - Terminator provides you with a find function so you can
search for text and regular expressions within your terminal (including the scrollback),
highlighting them all, in the style of <tt>less(1)</tt>, and offering quick movement to the
next or previous match.  As far as we know, the only other terminal emulator with a find
function is Apple's Terminal, and ours is better.
<p>Searches stay active until you cancel them, so if you're waiting for some particular
output in a great stream of output, this is a really great way to make it blindingly obvious
when it appears.

'(?i)shell'. Despite the evidence that a pager is running, this is Terminator doing the
highlighting&nbsp;&mdash; one of the authors uses <tt>cat(1)</tt> as his pager:
<p align="center" ><img src="mac-os-man-bash-find.png">

<li><p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> - Terminator will recognize the names of files, or
grep-like addresses consisting of a filename and line number, and automatically
turn the text into a link that will open the file in your configured editor. So <tt>grep -n</tt> output,
or <tt>svn update</tt> output, for example, becomes clickable.
<p>Terminator can also jump to the next/previous link, which is great for quickly scanning
voluminous build output.
<p>A screenshot of Terminator automatically providing links to <tt>grep(1)</tt> matches:
<p align="center"><img src="mac-os-grep.png">
<p>This works by reading your current directory from the window title, so
you'll need something like this in your <tt>bash(1)</tt> start-up scripts:
<blockquote><pre>
if [ "$TERM" == "terminator" ]
then
  export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\e2;`pwd`\a"'
fi
</pre></blockquote>

<li><p><strong>Number reinterpretation</strong> - Terminator will recognize numbers
in a variety of bases as the current selection, and add informational menu items to the
pop-up menu showing the same number in other bases. No more <tt>man ascii</tt> or resorting
to <tt>bc(1)</tt>.

<li><p><strong>Horizontal Scrolling</strong> - Most terminal emulators wrap text when it
intrudes upon the right margin.  Terminator doesn't - it instead provides a horizontal
scrollbar when necessary.  This brings clear benefits in terms of readability of program
output, or text files sent to the display with <tt>cat(1)</tt>. (We tried both this and Apple-like
reflowing of text when you change the window size, and we decided we preferred this. Sadly,
we don't have the resources to support two implementations, so reflowing isn't an option; it's
gone from the code.)

<li><p><strong>Multiple Tabs</strong> - Like tabbed browsing, only with terminals.

<li><p><strong>Automatic Logging</strong> - Complete logs are automatically generated of all your
terminal sessions.

<li><p><strong>Proper Tab Character Handling</strong> - Most terminal emulators will translate
tab characters into strings of spaces, which is very annoying if you then try to copy/paste
a section of text from your terminal into a text editor.  Terminator handles tabs properly,
remembering where the tabs are and copy/pasting them as tab characters.

<li><p><strong>Portability</strong> - Written in a combination of Java and POSIX C, Terminator
is the best terminal emulator you can run on both Linux and Mac OS, or any other Unix.

<li><p><strong>Consistent Look and Feel</strong> - Terminator will fit in on any platform.  It
looks perfectly at home on Linux systems, and blends seamlessly into Mac OS X.

<li><p><strong>Freedom</strong> - Terminator is released under the GPL.
</ul>

<p>We think Terminator is the clear choice for the discerning terminal user. Though originally written
for Linux to make up for the fact that no Linux terminal emulator was as good as Mac OS' Terminal, it has
now surpassed Terminal in several areas.

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The source distribution is here (<a href="terminator.tgz">terminator.tgz</a>),
but you'll also need a copy of the library to go with it (<a href="http://www.jessies.org/~enh/software/salma-hayek/salma-hayek.tgz">salma-hayek.tgz</a>).

<p>Terminator is written almost entirely in Java with a small C++ back-end
which runs a process connected to a pseudo-terminal. You will need at least
Java 1.4, and should use 1.5 if you can.

<p>Terminator will run fine on Mac OS, KDE, Gnome, or even an old-style X11
window manager like lwm. Now you can use the same terminal emulator everywhere!

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>We have made great efforts to ensure that Terminator is as easy to run as
possible. The native code will automatically be compiled the first time you run
Terminator on a new architecture, assuming you have <tt>make(1)</tt> and
<tt>g++(1)</tt> installed. A single Terminator installation may contain native
binaries for a variety of different architectures; this is handled
automatically.

<h3>Terminfo/Curses</h3>

<p>Terminator has its own terminfo file.  This will be installed in your home
directory unless Terminator is able to write to the system-wide
terminfo directory. This will only be the case if you run Terminator as root.

<h4>Logging in as other users/root</h4>
<p>If the terminfo file is only installed in your home directory then you
will see "terminal is not fully functional" problems when using <tt>su(1)</tt>
to switch to another user (although <tt>sudo(1)</tt> will work fine).

<p>For best results, on computers where you'll be logged in as root at times,
we recommend you install the terminfo file for Terminator in
<tt>/usr/share/terminfo</tt>. The easiest way to do this is to simply run
Terminator once as root. From then on, you can run Terminator as your normal
user, and use <tt>su(1)</tt> to become root.

<h4>Logging in to remote systems</h4>
<p>You will also need to ensure that any machines you'll be remotely logging
in to also have a copy of the terminfo file installed. If you share a home
directory on the local and remote machine, you'll have no trouble. Likewise if
someone has run Terminator as as root on the remote machine.

<p>(Note that if you're running Terminator on a remote machine, it probably
won't be able to open a window. Nonetheless, it will get far enough to set up
the terminfo file. Running Terminator on a remote machine as a matter of course
is usually a mistake. You should run Terminator locally and log in remotely.)

<p>If you're not able to run Terminator as root, you can copy
the terminfo file to <tt>~/.terminfo/t/terminator</tt> on the remote
machine (you'll need to <tt>mkdir -p ~/.terminfo/t</tt> if the directories
don't already exist). This is enough on most GNU-based systems, such as Linux;
if you still have problems (if 'vi' complains that the terminal is not fully
functional), add the following lines to <tt>~/.profile</tt> file on the remote
machine:
<pre>
export TERMINFO=~/.terminfo
export TERM=$TERM
</pre>

<h3>X11-style resources</h3>

<p>Terminator will look in <tt>~/.Xdefaults</tt> and <tt>~/.Xresources</tt> (in
that order, with the last-read setting overriding any earlier settings) for X11
resources of class <tt>XTerm</tt>, <tt>Rxvt</tt>, or <tt>Terminator</tt>. This
means that by default it will pick up the other programs' settings, but you can
have different settings for Terminator if you wish.

<p>Use <tt>terminator --help</tt> to see all the options, and their values.

<p>Common resources:
<dl>

<dt>loginShell
<dd>Whether or not the shell will be started with a <tt>-l</tt> argument.

<dt>scrollKey
<dd>Whether or not pressing a key should move the scrollbar to the bottom.

<dt>scrollTtyOutput
<dd>Whether or not output to the terminal should move the scrollbar to the
bottom.

<dt>title
<dd>The default title string for new terminals.

<dt>internalBorder
<dd>The number of pixels spacing between the text and the edge of the window.

</dl>

<p>Terminator-only resources:
<dl>

<dt>antiAlias
<dd>Whether or not to use anti-aliased text.

<dt>useMenuBar
<dd>Whether or not to use a menu bar. This defaults to false normally, but to
true on Mac OS.

<dt>initialRowCount
<dd>The number of lines in a newly-opened terminal.

<dt>initialColumnCount
<dd>The number of columns in a newly-opened terminal.

</dl>

<p>Terminator should use the same colors you usually see in <tt>xterm(1)</tt>
or <tt>rxvt(1)</tt>. In order to resolve color names to RGB values, Terminator
will read the file <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt</tt> if it exists. Without
this file, Terminator only understands colors in the form #rrggbb.

<p>If you don't have any colors configured, Terminator will use built-in
defaults similar to SGI's <tt>xwsh(1)</tt>.

<h2>Authors</h2>

<p>The original implementation and documentation was written by Phil Norman. Nearly all of the actual terminal emulation code remains unchanged.

<p>The original idea of having a suitably hackable terminal emulator with which to experiment with advanced features came from Elliott Hughes. Not being married with children, he now takes care of most of the development.

<p>The 'pty' program is based on code from one of the examples in the
book "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment", by W Richard Stevens.

<p>Phil wrote the code that took us from nothing to a more-or-less usable replacement for <tt>rxvt</tt> on his own between 2004-04-21 and 2004-05-28. Given that he was on holiday for a week during this time, that made roughly a month of development time.

<p>Since then, Terminator has been on the long slog towards Joel's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html">ten years</a> of quality.
