<h1>Terminator</h1>

<p><strong>Terminator is a GPL Unix terminal emulator with advanced features not
yet found elsewhere, replacing xterm, rxvt, xwsh and friends on X11 systems,
and Terminal.app on Mac OS X.</strong>

<p>Terminator will run on any Unix with Java 1.4 or later, and a C++ compiler.

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Here are some of the features unique to Terminator, or which are rare amongst the competition:

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Find</strong> - Terminator provides you with a find function so you can
search for text and regular expressions within your terminal (including the scrollback),
highlighting them all, in the style of <tt>less(1)</tt>, and offering quick movement to the
next or previous match.  As far as we know, the only other terminal emulator with a find
function is Apple's Terminal, and ours is better.

<p>Terminator running on Mac OS X, after running 'man bash', and doing a find for
'(?i)shell'.
<p>Searches stay active until you cancel them, so if you're waiting for some particular
output in a great stream of output, this is a really great way to make it blindingly obvious
when it appears.

<li><p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> - Terminator will recognize the names of files, or
grep-like addresses consisting of a filename and line number, and automatically
turn the text into a link that will open the file in your configured editor. So <tt>grep -n</tt> output,
or <tt>svn update</tt> output, for example, becomes clickable.

<li><p><strong>Number reinterpretation</strong> - Terminator will recognize numbers
in a variety of bases as the current selection, and add informational menu items to the
pop-up menu showing the same number in other bases. No more <tt>man ascii</tt> or resorting
to <tt>bc(1)</tt>.

<li><p><strong>Horizontal Scrolling</strong> - Most terminal emulators wrap text when it
intrudes upon the right margin.  Terminator doesn't - it instead provides a horizontal
scrollbar when necessary.  This brings clear benefits in terms of readability of program
output, or text files sent to the display with <tt>cat(1)</tt>. (We tried both this and Apple-like
reflowing of text when you change the window size, and we decided we preferred this. Sadly,
we don't have the resources to support two implementations, so reflowing isn't an option; it's
gone from the code.)

<li><p><strong>Multiple Tabs</strong> - Like tabbed browsing, only with terminals.

<li><p><strong>Automatic Logging</strong> - Complete logs are automatically generated of all your
terminal sessions.

<li><p><strong>Proper Tab Character Handling</strong> - Most terminal emulators will translate
tab characters into strings of spaces, which is very annoying if you then try to copy/paste
a section of text from your terminal into a text editor.  Terminator handles tabs properly,
remembering where the tabs are and copy/pasting them as tab characters.

<li><p><strong>Portability</strong> - Written in a combination of Java and POSIX C, Terminator
is the best terminal emulator you can run on both Linux and Mac OS, or any other Unix.

<li><p><strong>Consistent Look and Feel</strong> - Terminator will fit in on any platform.  It
looks perfectly at home on Linux systems, and blends seamlessly into Mac OS X.

<li><p><strong>Freedom</strong> - Terminator is released under the GPL.
</ul>

<p>We think Terminator is the clear choice for the discerning terminal user. Though originally written
for Linux to make up for the fact that no Linux terminal emulator was as good as Mac OS' Terminal, it has
now surpassed Terminal in several areas.

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The source distribution is here (<a href="terminator.tgz">terminator.tgz</a>),
but you'll also need a copy of the library to go with it (<a href="http://www.jessies.org/~enh/software/salma-hayek/salma-hayek.tgz">salma-hayek.tgz</a>).

<p>Terminator is written almost entirely in Java.  It has a small C++ back-end which runs
a process, probably <tt>bash(1)</tt>, connected to a pseudo-terminal.
For this reason, the native code is incredibly small and completely portable, and all we require
on the Java side is a reasonably recent JRE. You should use at least 1.4, and go with 1.5
if you can. The native code will automatically be recompiled assuming you
have <tt>make(1)</tt> and <tt>g++(1)</tt> installed.

<p>Terminator will run fine on KDE, Gnome, an old-style X11 window manager like lwm,
Mac OS, or anything else Java supports.  Linux users can now change their desktop
environment without recompiling their terminal emulator, or having to switch to a new one!

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>We have made great efforts to ensure that Terminator is as easy to run as possible.
The back-end C code will be compiled automatically the first time you run Terminator (assuming
you have 'make', 'gcc' and 'g++' installed), and the start-up script tries to ensure that the
relevant terminfo entry is installed in the user's home directory.

<h3>Terminfo/Curses</h3>

<p>For best results, on computers where you'll be root some of the time, we recommend you
install the terminfo file for Terminator in /usr/share/terminfo.  How this may be done is
described in the doc/README file.

<p>You will also need to ensure that any machines you'll be remotely logging into (through ssh,
telnet or whatever) also have a copy of the terminfo file installed.  This can be done by copying
the terminfo file to ~/.terminfo/t/terminator (creating the .terminfo and .terminfo/t directories)
on the host machine.  This is enough on most GNU-based systems, such as Linux; if
you still have problems (if 'vi' complains that the terminal is not fully functional), add the following
lines to your ~/.profile file on the host machine:

<pre>
export TERMINFO=~/.terminfo
export TERM=$TERM
</pre>

<p>This informs the host system of where your user terminfo files are to be found (GNU-based
systems look for this directory automatically).

<h2>Authors</h2>

<p>The original implementation and documentation was written by Phil Norman. Nearly all of the actual terminal emulation code remains unchanged.

<p>The original idea of having a suitably hackable terminal emulator with which to experiment with advanced features came from Elliott Hughes. Not being married with children, he now takes care of most of the development.

<p>The 'pty' program is based on code from one of the examples in the
book "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment", by W Richard Stevens.

<p>Phil wrote the code that took us from nothing to a more-or-less usable replacement for <tt>rxvt</tt> on his own between 2004-04-21 and 2004-05-28. Given that he was on holiday for a week during this time, that makes roughly a month of development time. Since then, Terminator has been on the long slog towards Joel's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html">ten years</a> of quality.
