<h1>Terminator</h1>

<p><strong>Terminator is a GPL terminal emulator with advanced features not
yet found elsewhere, suitable to replace xterm, rxvt, xwsh and friends on X11 systems,
Terminal.app on Mac OS X and PuTTY on MS&nbsp;Windows.</strong>

<p>Terminator will run on any modern POSIX system with Java 5 or later and a C++ compiler.

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Here are some of the features unique to Terminator, or which are rare amongst the competition:

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Logging</strong> - Complete logs are automatically generated of all your
terminal sessions.

<li><p><strong>Find</strong> - Terminator provides you with a find function so you can
search for text and regular expressions within your terminal (including the scrollback),
highlighting them all, in the style of <tt>less(1)</tt>, and offering quick movement to the
next or previous match.  As far as we know, the only other terminal emulator with a find
function is Apple's Terminal, and ours is better.
<p>Searches stay active until you cancel them, so if you're waiting for some particular
output in a great stream of output, this is a really great way to make it blindingly obvious
when it appears.
<p>A screenshot of Terminator on Mac OS X, after running 'man bash', and doing a find for
'(?i)shell':
<p align="center" ><img src="mac-os-man-bash-find.png" alt="mac-os-man-bash-find.png">
<p>Despite the evidence that a pager is running, this is Terminator doing the
highlighting&nbsp;&mdash; one of the authors uses <tt>cat(1)</tt> as his pager.

<li><p><strong>Drop Target</strong> - Text and URLs, and even files from
Finder/Nautilus/Windows Explorer can be dropped on Terminator to be inserted
as text, with automatic quoting of filenames containing shell metacharacters.

<li><p><strong>Freedom</strong> - Terminator is released under the GPL.

<li><p><strong>Horizontal Scrolling</strong> - Most terminal emulators wrap text when it
intrudes upon the right margin.  Terminator doesn't &mdash; it instead provides a horizontal
scrollbar when necessary.  This brings clear benefits in terms of readability of program
output, or text files sent to the display with <tt>cat(1)</tt>. (We tried both this and Apple-like
reflowing of text when you change the window size, and we decided we preferred this. Sadly,
we don't have the resources to support two implementations, so reflowing isn't an option; it's
gone from the code.)

<li><p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> - Terminator will recognize the names of files, or
grep-like addresses consisting of a filename and line number, and automatically
turn the text into a link that will open the file in your configured editor. So <tt>grep -n</tt> output,
or <tt>svn update</tt> output, for example, becomes clickable.
<p>Terminator can also jump to the next/previous link, which is great for quickly scanning
voluminous build output.
<p>A screenshot of Terminator automatically providing links to <tt>grep(1)</tt> matches:
<p align="center"><img src="mac-os-grep.png" alt="mac-os-grep.png">
<p>This works by reading your current directory from the window title, so
you'll need something like this in your <tt>bash(1)</tt> start-up scripts:
<pre>
if [ "$TERM" == "terminator" ]
then
  export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\e2;`pwd`\a"'
fi
</pre>

<li><p><strong>Multiple Tabs</strong> - Like tabbed browsing, only with terminals.

<li><p><strong>Number reinterpretation</strong> - Terminator will recognize numbers
in a variety of bases as the current selection, and add informational menu items to the
pop-up menu showing the same number in other bases. No more <tt>man ascii</tt> or resorting
to <tt>bc(1)</tt>.

<li><p><strong>Portability</strong> - Written in a combination of Java and POSIX C++, Terminator
should compile out of the box on most modern desktop operating systems.

<li><p><strong>Proper Tab Character Handling</strong> - Most terminal emulators will translate
tab characters into strings of spaces, which is very annoying if you then try to copy/paste
a section of text from your terminal into a text editor.  Terminator handles tabs properly,
remembering where the tabs are and copy/pasting them as tab characters.

<li><p><strong>UTF-8</strong> - Terminator won't mangle your favorite accented characters, and it copes well with languages such as Greek where there's a mix of normal and wide glyphs:
<p align="center"><img src="mac-os-greek.png" alt="mac-os-greek.png">
<p>The text is Markus Kuhn's <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-demo.txt">UTF-8-demo.txt</a> if you want to see what a mess Terminal.app makes of it. (Terminal.app beats us on Thai, but we're better at Cyrillic, Greek, and Japanese.) The non-default settings in the screenshot were achieved thus:
<blockquote><tt>terminator -xrm fontName:Monaco -xrm fontSize:13 -xrm antiAlias:true -xrm foreground:black -xrm background:white -xrm selectionColor:\#b4d5fe</tt></blockquote>
<p>One side-effect of proper support for variable-width glyphs is that you're not restricted to fixed-width fonts in Terminator, even if the only language you're using is English. GNU readline might get confused about the line length, though.
<p>Here's a more convincingly terminal-like example of fixed-width English and variable-width Japanese; output from javac(1):
<p align="center"><img src="javac-jp-monaco.png" alt="javac-jp-monaco.png">
</ul>

<p>We think Terminator is the clear choice for the discerning terminal user. Though originally written
for Linux to make up for the fact that no Linux terminal emulator was as good as Mac OS X's Terminal, it has
now surpassed Terminal in several areas.

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The distribution is here (<a href="terminator.tgz">terminator.tgz</a>),
but you'll also need a copy of the library to go with it (<a href="../salma-hayek/salma-hayek.tgz">salma-hayek.tgz</a>).

<p>The distribution only usually contains binaries for Linux.
We also have binaries for
<a href="terminator-Cygwin.tgz">Cygwin</a>
and <a href="terminator-Darwin.tgz">Mac OS X</a>.

<p>On Cygwin, you'll also need launcher.exe from salma-hayek,
which you can build yourself or find in the
<a href="../salma-hayek/salma-hayek-Cygwin.tgz">salma-hayek Cygwin binary distribution</a>.

<p>The <a href="ChangeLog.html">ChangeLog</a> is available separately.

<p>Terminator is written almost entirely in Java with a small bit of JNI
which runs a process connected to a pseudo-terminal. You will need
Java 1.5.  You'll need to point $JAVA_HOME at the root of your JDK.

<p>On Windows, you will need Cygwin.  The current version at the time of porting
was 1.5.18-1.  The startup script requires Ruby, which isn't part of Cygwin's default
installation.  It's easily added to an additional installation (by a human but not, sadly,
by the script) by rerunning the installer.  You might also want the net.inetutils package
which is where Cygwin's telnet lives.  If you only have the JRE installed, then you may
want to rerun the JRE installer and choose a Custom installation so that you get
LucidaTypewriterRegular.ttf installed, otherwise you'll end up with Courier and being
unable to distinguish l and 1.

<p>(NT's built-in POSIX subsystem won't let you launch Win32 applications or
interact with the network, so that wasn't an option.
Cygwin, on the other hand, even contains the Unix98 pseudo-terminal support which
we use to support window resizing, not to mention containing a port of one of
the most widely used ssh programs.)

<p>To build Terminator, you'll need g++ and a very recent make.  Debian's make-3.80-9 is
fine.  The make which comes with Mac OS X 10.4.2 isn't.  The make which comes with Cygwin
1.5.18-1 isn't.
Debian's make source (apt-get source make) compiles and works fine on Mac OS X and Cygwin.
<a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/make/make-3.81beta3.tar.gz">make-3.81beta3</a> is also good.
We have binaries for <a href="../3rdParty/make-3.80-9/Darwin/make">Mac OS X</a>
and <a href="../3rdParty/make-3.80-9/Cygwin/make.exe">Cygwin</a>.

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>Terminator will run fine on Mac OS X, Windows, KDE, GNOME, or even an old-style X11
window manager like lwm. Now you can use the same terminal emulator everywhere!

<p>We have made some effort to ensure that Terminator is easy to run.
The native code will automatically be compiled the first time you run
Terminator on a new architecture, assuming you have <tt>make(1)</tt> and
<tt>g++(1)</tt> installed. A single Terminator installation may contain native
binaries for a variety of different architectures; this is handled
automatically.

<h3>Terminfo/Curses</h3>

<p>Terminator has its own terminfo file.  This will be installed in your home
directory unless Terminator is able to write to the system-wide
terminfo directory. This will only be the case if you run Terminator as root.

<h4>Logging in as other users/root</h4>
<p>If the terminfo file is only installed in your home directory then you
will see "terminal is not fully functional" problems when using <tt>su(1)</tt>
to switch to another user (although <tt>sudo(1)</tt> will work fine).

<p>For best results, on computers where you'll be logged in as root at times,
we recommend you install the terminfo file for Terminator in
<tt>/usr/share/terminfo</tt>. The easiest way to do this is to simply run
Terminator once as root. From then on, you can run Terminator as your normal
user, and use <tt>su(1)</tt> to become root.

<h4>Logging in to remote systems</h4>
<p>You will also need to ensure that any machines you'll be remotely logging
in to also have a copy of the terminfo file installed. If you share a home
directory on the local and remote machine, you'll have no trouble. Likewise if
someone has run Terminator as as root on the remote machine.

<p>(Note that if you're running Terminator on a remote machine, it probably
won't be able to open a window. Nonetheless, it will get far enough to set up
the terminfo file. Running Terminator on a remote machine as a matter of course
is usually a mistake. You should run Terminator locally and log in remotely.)

<p>If you're not able to run Terminator as root, you can copy
the terminfo file to <tt>~/.terminfo/t/terminator</tt> on the remote
machine (you'll need to <tt>mkdir -p ~/.terminfo/t</tt> if the directories
don't already exist). This is enough on most GNU-based systems, such as Linux;
if you still have problems (if 'vi' complains that the terminal is not fully
functional), add the following lines to <tt>~/.profile</tt> file on the remote
machine:
<pre>
export TERMINFO=~/.terminfo
export TERM=$TERM
</pre>

<h3>Pasting in VNC</h3>

<p>If you're using an old version of VNC, you may experience problems pasting into Terminator, accompanied by the following exception:
<pre>
java.awt.datatransfer.UnsupportedFlavorException: Unicode String
</pre>
<p>This is caused by a bug in old versions of the X11 VNC server. On Debian, you should remove the <tt>vncserver</tt> package and install the <tt>vnc4server</tt> package, and run <tt>vnc4server</tt> (it takes the same arguments as <tt>vncserver</tt>)&nbsp;&mdash; just upgrading your existing <tt>vncserver</tt> package will not help. Switching package will also a fix a bunch of other problems you may or may not have noticed with VNC.

<h3>X11-style resources</h3>

<p>Terminator will look in <tt>~/.Xdefaults</tt> and <tt>~/.Xresources</tt> (in
that order, with the last-read setting overriding any earlier settings) for X11
resources of class <tt>XTerm</tt>, <tt>Rxvt</tt>, or <tt>Terminator</tt>. This
means that by default it will pick up the other programs' settings, but you can
have different settings for Terminator if you wish.

<p>Use <tt>terminator --help</tt> to see all the options, their explanations,
and their values.

<p>Terminator should use the same colors you usually see in <tt>xterm(1)</tt>
or <tt>rxvt(1)</tt>. In order to resolve color names to RGB values, Terminator
will read the file <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt</tt> if it exists. Without
this file, Terminator only understands colors in the form #rrggbb.

<p>If you don't have any colors configured, Terminator will use built-in
defaults similar to SGI's <tt>xwsh(1)</tt>.

<p>Terminator uses the same names for fonts as Java. (This is why we use
different resources to specify a font, and won't even try to translate X11
logical font descriptions.)

<h3>Running on Windows</h3>

<p>We don't yet have any nicely packaged double-click installer.
Sorry, you'll need to create your own Shortcut on the Desktop.
This is the command I use in the Shortcut:

<pre>
C:\cygwin\bin\rubyw.exe /cygdrive/f/software.jessies.org/terminator/bin/terminator
</pre>

<p>Note the use of a Cygwin-style path rather than F:\software.jessies.org\terminator\bin\terminator.

<p>If you're having trouble starting terminator, you may want to try running it from bash
instead of from the icon until you work out what's wrong.
That's because rubyw.exe is a version of Ruby linked with the --subsystem windows instead of
--subsystem console.
This subsystem throws away the standard I/O streams but it does mean that you don't get
a spurious window.
Any console output from the Java, as opposed to the start-up script, is recorded in a file in
$HOME/.terminal-logs/ along with a file containing a log of each tab's output.

<p>You can get a new terminal window very quickly, running in the same virtual machine, with Alt-N.
That's much quicker than what happens when you double-click on the icon.

<h2>Authors</h2>

<p>The original implementation and documentation was written by Phil Norman. Nearly all of the actual terminal emulation code remains unchanged.

<p>The original idea of having a suitably hackable terminal emulator with which to experiment with advanced features came from Elliott Hughes. Not being married with children, he now takes care of most of the development.

<p>Phil wrote the code that took us from nothing to a more-or-less usable replacement for <tt>rxvt</tt> on his own between 2004-04-21 and 2004-05-28. Given that he was on holiday for a week during this time, that made roughly a month of development time.

<p>Since then, Terminator has been on the long slog towards Joel's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html">ten years</a> of quality.
