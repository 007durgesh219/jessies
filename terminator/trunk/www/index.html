<title>Terminator - a virtual terminal emulator</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Terminator</h1>

<p><strong>Terminator is a free, functional terminal emulator, replacing xterm, rxvt, xwsh
and friends on Unix systems, and Terminal.app on MacOS X.</strong>

<p>Terminator gives you a variety of features extremely useful to have in a terminal
emulator, in a package which will run on Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X, BSD, IRIX, and probably
quite a few other platforms too.

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Well, what separates Terminator from the competition?  Here's a list:

<ul>
<li><strong>Portability</strong> - Written in a combination of Java and POSIX C, Terminator
	will run practically anywhere, with only a simple recompile of the C code.  If you use different
	operating systems (for example, unix at work and Mac OS X at home), Terminator is
	the only decent terminal emulator you can use on both systems.  Gone is the pain of
	having to switch back and forth between different sets of hotkeys and functionality.

<li><strong>Consistent Look and Feel</strong> - Terminator will fit in on any platform.  It
	looks perfectly at home on Linux systems, and blends seamlessly into Mac OS X.

<li><strong>Horizontal Scrolling</strong> - Most terminal emulators wrap text when it
	intrudes upon the right margin.  Terminator doesn't - it instead provides a horizontal
	scrollbar when necessary.  This brings clear benefits in terms of readability of program
	output (or catted text files).

<li><strong>Find</strong> - Terminator provides you with a find function so you can
	search for text and regular expressions within your terminal (including the scrollback),
	highlighting them clearly.  As far as I know, the only other terminal emulator with a find
	function is Apple's Terminal.

<li><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> - Terminator will understand http, ftp, https, mailto, telnet,
	ssh and rsh hyperlinks, will highlight them, and will run a program to deal with them when
	you click on them.  You can add extra hyperlink recognisers as you like, change the
	programs to be run, or remove ones you don't want.  Hyperlinks are recognised using
	regular expressions.

<li><strong>Tabbed Shelling</strong> - Like tabbed browsing, only with terminals.  Unlike
	other terminal emulators with tabbed shelling, with Terminator you can flip through the tabs
	with hotkeys.

<li><strong>Automatic Logging</strong> - Logs are automatically generated of all your
	terminal sessions.

<li><strong>Proper Tab Character Handling</strong> - Most terminal emulators will translate
	tab characters into strings of spaces, which is very annoying if you then try to copy/paste
	a section of text from your terminal into a text editor.  Terminator handles tabs properly,
	remembering where the tabs are and copy/pasting them as tab characters.

<li><strong>Freedom</strong> - Terminator is released under the GPL licence.  If you don't
	like how some aspect of it works, you can always modify it.
</ul>

<p>We're aiming to make Terminator the clear choice for the discerning terminal user, so if
you have any suggestions for new features, or how the program can be made more pleasing
to use, please <a href="mailto:cuvy.abezna@virgin.net">let me know about it</a>.

<h2>A Word About Speed</h2>

<p>Many people have the misconception that Java is slow, and whereas that was true in
1999, Java's performance these days is extremely slick.  I run Terminator all the time on
my 700MHz PC, and it's as responsive as I could wish for.

<h2>Download</h2>

<p><a href="TerminatorN-bindist.tgz">Download Terminator v1.1 Binary</a> - The Java
binaries will, of course, work on any system.  The C program will be automatically
recompiled if necessary (assuming you have make and gcc/g++ installed).

<p><a href="TerminatorN-2004-06-03.tar.gz">Download Terminator v1.1 Source</a>,
and also <a href="salma-hayek-2004-06-03.tar.gz">some more source</a>.  The latter link
is a Java library which Terminator relies upon.  Both archives contain compiled class files for
all the java source, so you can just go into the TerminatorN directory and execute the 'terminator'
script.

<h3>Older Versions</h3>

<p><a href="TerminatorN-2004-05-28.tar.gz">Download Terminator v1.0 Source</a>,
and also <a href="salma-hayek-2004-05-28.tar.gz">some more source</a>.  The latter link

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>Terminator is written almost entirely in Java.  It has a small C back-end which runs
processes in a pty (in simple terms, the C code just does the stuff we can't do in Java).
For this reason, the C code is incredibly small and completely portable, and all we require
on the Java side is a reasonably recent JRE (you should use at least 1.4, although 1.5 fixes
a fair few bugs in Swing, so I'd recommend it even though it's only beta at the moment).

<p>Because of our use of Java, we don't have the same problems as many of the modern
terminal emulators which, although better in terms of features than their more vintage
counterparts, tend to be absolute hell to compile.  They all seem to require a vast number of rather large
libraries, which in turn need yet more libraries.  If you've ever tried building a KDE application
without having KDE first, you'll know what I mean.

<p>Terminator, on the other hand, will run fine on KDE, on Gnome, lwm, or any other windowing system
you care to imagine.  You can change your desktop environment without even recompiling
your terminal emulator.


<hr>
<h2>Running</h2>

<p>We have made great efforts to ensure that Terminator is as easy to run as possible.
The back-end C code will be compiled automatically the first time you run Terminator (assuming
you have 'make', 'gcc' and 'g++' installed), and the start-up script tries to ensure that the
relevant terminfo entry is installed in the user's home directory.


<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Terminator expects to find a file called ~/.terminator, where it reads information about how
to recognise hyperlinks, and what programs to run when you click on them.  The start-up script
will attempt to guess what type of windowing system you're using (known systems are Mac OS X,
KDE and Gnome), and if no ~/.terminator file is present, it will copy the relevant one from the
distribution directory (doc/props-examples/).  If you're using a different system, you'll have to
do this manually.

<p>If you find that some of the guesses are wrong, for example if you prefer
to use mozilla rather than konqueror to open http: URLs, just edit the ~/.terminator file and change
the relevant entries.  You can, of course, disable entries, or add extra ones as you like.


<h3>Terminfo/Curses</h3>

<p>For best results, on computers where you'll be root some of the time, we recommend you
install the terminfo file for Terminator in /usr/share/terminfo.  How this may be done is
described in the doc/README file in both source and binary distributions.

<p>You will also need to ensure that any machines you'll be remotely logging into (through ssh,
telnet or whatever) also have a copy of the terminfo file installed.  This can be done by copying
the terminfo file to ~/.terminfo/t/terminator (creating the .terminfo and .terminfo/t directories)
on the host machine.  This is enough on most GNU-based systems, like Linux for example; if
you still have problems (if 'vi' complains that the terminal is not fully functional), add the following
lines to your ~/.profile file on the host machine:

<pre>
export TERMINFO=~/.terminfo
export TERM=$TERM
</pre>

<p>This informs the host system of where your user terminfo files are to be found (GNU-based
systems look for this directory automatically).

<h2>Who Wrote It?</h2>

<p>The original idea, and quite a bit of the Java code came from
<a href="http://www.enh.demon.co.uk/">Elliott Hughes</a>.

<p>All the Java code he didn't write and the documentation was by me, Phil Norman.

<p>The code-base for the 'pty' program was stolen from one of the examples in the
"Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" book, by W Richard Stevens.

<p>Development began on 21st April 2004, v1.0 has been released today, the 28th
May 2004.  Given that I was on holiday for a week
during this time, that makes it roughly a month of development time.

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>If you have bugs to report, please email them to <a href="mailto:cuvy.abezna@virgin.net">
Phil Norman</a>.

<p>If you're dead impressed you might want to consider offering me a job.  Something
Java programming related in Berkshire, UK would be nice.
