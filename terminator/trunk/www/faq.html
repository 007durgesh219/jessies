<h1>Terminator FAQ</h1>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Where can I get a nice terminal font?</h2>
<p>Terminator will try to choose a good fixed-width/monospaced font for you, but it can only choose from what you have installed.

<p>On Mac OS, you already have the traditional (for Apple) Monaco and an alternative of Lucida Sans Typewriter.

<p>On Linux and Windows, if you have the JRE installed (rather than the JDK), then you may want to rerun the JRE installer and choose a "Custom" installation so that you get LucidaTypewriterRegular.ttf installed, otherwise on Windows you'll end up with Courier and being unable to distinguish the letter l from the number 1.

<p>Many Windows users recommend <a href="http://www.proggyfonts.com/">proggy fonts</a>. You can also use these fonts on other operating systems, though in all cases you should download the TrueType version rather than the version specifically for your OS, because Terminator needs the TrueType version.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>How can I set the window/tab title from the shell?</h3>
<p>Assuming you're using Bash, you need a function like this in your <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt>:
<pre>
    setWindowTitle() {
        echo -ne "\e]2;$*\a"
    }
</pre>
<p>You can call this with any argument to set the window's title to that string. If the terminal running this is in a tab, the tab's title will be changed; a window with multiple tabs takes its title from the current tab.

<p>This function will work for XTerm and most other terminal emulators too. One place it won't work is the Linux text console. For that reason, I recommend surrounding all the code in this FAQ section with something like this:
<pre>
if [ "$TERM" == "terminator" ]
then
    # window-title stuff here.
fi
</pre>

<p>If you have a prompt something like this:
<pre>
    export PS1="\[\033[33m\]\h:\w\$ \[\033[0m\]"
</pre>
<p>You might want to achieve a similar effect in your title bar. Annoyingly, those \h and \w escapes (hostname without domain name and directory with $HOME rewritten as ~, respectively) only work in the PS1 environment variable. Luckily, Bash offers you an alternative way to achieve the same effect without the cost of running external programs (a common work-around):
<pre>
    updateWindowTitle() {
        setWindowTitle "${HOSTNAME%%.*}:${PWD/$HOME/~}"
    }
    PROMPT_COMMAND=updateWindowTitle
</pre>
<p>Read the Bash manual page for full details of PS1, PROMPT_COMMAND, or the advanced forms of substitution.

<h3>Why am I having problems with terminfo/curses?</h3>

<p>Terminator has its own terminfo file. This is regrettably necessary because of Terminator's unconventional approach to handling wide lines with a horizontal scrollbar rather than by wrapping them. The file will be installed under <tt>~/.terminfo</tt> the first time you run Terminator. If you used an installer that runs as root and can write to the system-wide terminfo directory (currently just the Linux installer), the terminfo file will be installed system-wide at install time.

<p>If you run Terminator itself as root and the terminfo file has not been installed in the system-wide terminfo directory, it will be installed at that point.

<p>If the terminfo file isn't available, the most common warnings you'll see are this one from programs such as <tt>less(1)</tt>:
<pre>
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
-  (press RETURN)
</pre>
<p>and this one, from <tt>vim(1)</tt>:
<pre>
E558: Terminal entry not found in terminfo
'terminator' not known. Available builtin terminals are:
    builtin_riscos
    builtin_amiga
    builtin_beos-ansi
    builtin_ansi
    builtin_pcansi
    builtin_win32
    builtin_vt320
    builtin_vt52
    builtin_xterm
    builtin_iris-ansi
    builtin_debug
    builtin_dumb
defaulting to 'ansi'
</pre>

<p>If you think you have the correct terminfo available but you're still having problems, the next thing to check is that you're actually <i>using</i> Terminator's terminfo. For example, if your problem is with your shell, check that <tt>echo $TERM</tt> says "terminator", and if your problem is with Vim, check that <tt>:se term</tt> says "term=terminator". (Although Terminator sets the TERM environment variable for you, it may be being overridden by your shell's profile, say, and it won't necessarily be correctly transferred if you log in to a remote machine, so it's always worth checking.)

<h4>Cygwin</h4>
<p>Cygwin's less(1) still uses a termcap-based ncurses library.
If less(1) (and hence man(1)) say "WARNING: terminal is not fully functional", try:
<pre>
infocmp -C >> ~/.termcap
</pre>

<h4>FreeBSD</h4>
<p>FreeBSD systems don't come with the necessary terminfo support installed by
default.  It's apparently a snap to install the
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/devel/ncurses/pkg-descr">devel/ncurses</a>
package from the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/">FreeBSD Ports and Packages Collection</a>.

<h4>Logging in as other users/root</h4>
<p>If the terminfo file is not installed in the system-wide location then other users (and you yourself, if you use <tt>su(1)</tt> to switch to another user) will have problems. Using <tt>sudo(1)</tt> to run a command as another user will work in many cases, because it doesn't alter <tt>$HOME</tt> by default.

<p>For best results, on computers where you'll be logged in as root at times, we recommend you install the terminfo file for Terminator in <tt>/usr/share/terminfo</tt>. The easiest way to do this is to simply run Terminator once as root. From then on, you can run Terminator as your normal user, and use <tt>su(1)</tt> to become root.

<h4>Logging in to remote systems</h4>
<p>You will also need to ensure that any machines you'll be remotely logging in to also have a copy of the terminfo file installed. If you use the same home directory on the local and remote machines, everything will just work. Likewise if someone has already run Terminator as root on the remote machine.

<p>(Note that if you try to run Terminator on a remote machine, it probably won't get as far as opening a window. Nonetheless, it will get far enough to set up the terminfo file. Note also that running Terminator on a remote machine as a matter of course is usually a mistake, and will be <i>much</i> slower than running Terminator on your local machine and simply logging in to the remote machine from within Terminator using ssh(1) or whatever.)

<p>If you're not able to run Terminator as root, you can simply run Terminator as yourself on the remote machine.

<p>If you can't easily install or run Terminator on the remote machine, you only need to copy the terminfo file to <tt>~/.terminfo/t/terminator</tt> (you'll need to <tt>mkdir -p ~/.terminfo/t</tt> if the directories don't already exist).

<p>On Linux or Mac OS, and most other ncurses-based systems, this is all you need to do. If you still have problems like the ones shown at the start of this section, add the following lines to your profile on the remote machine:
<pre>
export TERMINFO=~/.terminfo
export TERM=$TERM
</pre>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Why can't I paste in VNC?</h2>

<p>If you're using an old version of VNC, you may experience problems pasting into Terminator, with the following exception in the "Debugging Messages":
<pre>
java.awt.datatransfer.UnsupportedFlavorException: Unicode String
</pre>
<p>This is caused by a bug in old versions of the X11 VNC server. On Debian, you should remove the <tt>vncserver</tt> package and install the <tt>vnc4server</tt> package, and run <tt>vnc4server</tt> (it takes the same arguments as <tt>vncserver</tt>)&nbsp;&mdash; just upgrading your existing <tt>vncserver</tt> package will not help. Switching package will also a fix a bunch of other problems you may or may not have noticed with VNC.
