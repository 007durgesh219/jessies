README file for Terminator.

In the sub-directory 'props-examples' there are some examples of
'.terminator' properties files.  The names should give you some
clues as to which one might be right for you.  Simply copy one of
these into your home directory, changing its name to
'.terminator', and then glance through the file to see if there's
anything which needs changing.  Typical examples of things you
might want to modify include the commands executed when hyperlinks
are clicked on.

You can, of course, add more types of hyperlinks by copying an
existing hyperlink entry, inventing a new name for it, and
modifying it as you see fit.  You'll need to know some regexp to
do this.  The regexp used is that built into the Java runtime
libraries (as of version 1.4), and is almost identical to the
syntax used in Perl regexp.
