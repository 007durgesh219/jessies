Unassigned TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[5] Implement window size change notification. Grep for TIOCSWINSZ in the rxvt source. Basically, we have to do an ioctl on the relevant fd. And only pty knows that. Martin suggests TELNET IAC-like signaling in the byte stream to pty.
[5]     Fix backspace in vim on Linux; it deletes forwards, and is driving me mad whenever I write a checkin comment. Must start work on CheckInTool.
[5]     Fix ^C. It works fine if you've started Terminator from another terminal emulator (xterm, say), but if you start it from the GNOME panel, it doesn't. stty -a can't see any difference.
[1]	Add bracket-matching double-click selection?
[1]	Parse Mac OS Terminal.app settings. (Only if running on Mac OS?)
[1]	Implement 'mode 1'.
[1]	Feedback on other tabs when there's been output you haven't seen yet?
[1]	cursorColor should default to foreground rather than black.



Phil's TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~
[5]	Implement wrapping.
[5]	Fix redraw bug - strange redraw effects happen when editing a CVS commit comment in vim.



Elliott's TODOs:
