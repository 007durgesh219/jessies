When adding stuff, please put a priority to its left.  Priorities range from 1-5, with
5 most important and 1 least.


Unassigned TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[5] Implement ESC[4h - insert mode (ESC[4l resets back to the usual replace mode).
[5]	Implement 'mode 1'.
[3]	Implement 'mode 47' - alternate buffer support.
[3]	Cope with '\t'. Remember tab stops are settable.
[3]	Add ssh support.
[1]	Fix double-click selection so it selects a word (maybe bracket-matching aswell).
[1]	Parse Mac OS Terminal.app settings. (Only if running on Mac OS?)
[1]	Fix scrolling with the scroll bar arrows and mouse wheel. elliotth fixed it once (implementing Scrollable in JTelnetPane), but we've broken it again somewhere along the line.
[1]     We should start a timer on mouseExited and stop it on mouseEntered that jogs the auto-scrolling. Having to wiggle the mouse to produce mouseDragged events is stupid, even if it's what you have to do with PuTTY and gnome-terminal. Apple's Terminal does it right, so we should too.

Elliott's TODOs:

[3]	Implement searching.
[3]	Add hyperlink following support for stuff like http: mailto: and telnet:
[1] Implement something like gnome-terminal's ability to name each tab on the command-line.
[1] Implement X11-style "-xrm resource-string" options, rather than the whole mess of xterm options.
