TODO file for the Terminator project.
This file contains all the stuff which still needs to be decided, considered or done.
If you want to take over an item, please assign it to yourself in your own section.
When adding stuff, please put a priority to its left.  Priorities range from 1-5, with
5 most important and 1 least.


Unassigned TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[5]	Fix backspace in vim on Linux; it deletes forwards, and is driving me mad whenever I write a checkin comment. Must start work on CheckInTool.
[5]	Fix ^C. It works fine if you've started Terminator from another terminal emulator (xterm, say), but if you start it from the GNOME panel, it doesn't. stty -a can't see any difference.
[3]	Review the current properties reading, and see if it's really going to work well enough.  Possibly add "?MacOS:" stuff to it.
[1]	Add bracket-matching double-click selection?
[1]	Parse Mac OS Terminal.app settings. (Only if running on Mac OS?)
[1]	Implement 'mode 1'.
[1]	Feedback on other tabs when there's been output you haven't seen yet?
[1]	cursorColor should default to foreground rather than black.
[1]	Shouldn't log while in alternate buffer mode.

If we find life is unbearable without line wrapping:
[1]	Get the wrapping toggle on/off to wrap/unwrap the text when triggered.
[1]	Fix line wrapping so it really works properly, including getting highlighters to ignore fake line breaks.

Elliott's TODOs:

[1] Add resources or other configuration file for hyperlink recognizers. Maybe allow arbitrary classes to be instantiated?
