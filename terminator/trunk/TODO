TODO file for the Terminator project.
This file contains all the stuff which still needs to be decided, considered or done.
If you want to take over an item, please assign it to yourself in your own section.
When adding stuff, please put a priority to its left.  Priorities range from 1-5, with
5 most important and 1 least.


Unassigned TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[5]	Implement 'mode 1' - client-side manipulation of the cursor position when the
	cursor keys are used.
[3]	Implement 'mode 47' - alternate buffer support.
[3]	Cope with '\t'. Remember tab stops are settable.
[3]	Add ssh support.
[1]	Fix double-click selection so it selects a word (maybe bracket-matching aswell).
[1]	Parse Mac OS Terminal.app settings. (Only if running on Mac OS?)
[1]	Override TERM environment variable to help ensure that our children have an accurate idea of our capabilities (and so we only have one major target to support)?
[1]	Pass '-i' to shell. bash doesn't seem to correctly recognize that it should be interactive otherwise. [I think I was confused when I wrote this, and don't think this is relevant.]
[1]	Fix scrolling with the scroll bar arrows and mouse wheel. elliotth fixed it once (implementing Scrollable in JTelnetPane), but we've broken it again somewhere along the line.



Phil's TODOs:

Elliott's TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~
[3]	Implement searching.
[3]	Add hyperlink following support for stuff like http: mailto: and telnet:
[1] Implement something like gnome-terminal's ability to name each tab on the command-line.
[1] Implement X11-style "-xrm resource-string" options, rather than the whole mess of xterm options.
