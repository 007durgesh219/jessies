TODO file for the Terminator project.
This file contains all the stuff which still needs to be decided, considered or done.
If you want to take over an item, please assign it to yourself in your own section.
When adding stuff, please put a priority to its left.  Priorities range from 1-5, with
5 most important and 1 least.


Unassigned TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[5]	Hitting alt-k a number of times results in no redraw of the prompt.  I think bash tries to be clever.
[5]	Change the naming of 'Control' and 'Controller'.  It's confusing.
[5]	Refactor to make Terminator the main application, responsible for a number of TerminatorFrame objects.
[5]	Fix ^W in less.
[5]	Resizing the terminal window causes an automatic scroll to the bottom.  This shouldn't happen.
[5]	Make an about box.
[5]	Implement "New Window" to go with "New Tab".
[3]	Review the current properties reading, and see if it's really going to work well enough.  Possibly add "?MacOS:" stuff to it.
[2]	Find some profiling tool to see if we can find simple ways of speeding up.
[1]	Add bracket-matching double-click selection?
[1]	Parse Mac OS Terminal.app settings. (Only if running on Mac OS?)
[1]	Feedback on other tabs when there's been output you haven't seen yet?
[1]	Shouldn't log while in alternate buffer mode.
[1]	Add ability to view more than one terminal at a time, in a split pane, or in a 2d-tiled layout.

Elliott's TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~
[1] Add resources or other configuration file for hyperlink recognizers. Maybe allow arbitrary classes to be instantiated?
[1] "Connect to Server" CS-K; don't implement Rendevouz (unless you're bored!) but take (user@)?host and port-scan for ssh, and fall back to telnet.
* Don't do defaults in code; if we have something in the options HashMap, it's
  self-documenting.
* Try to make sure we never cache options. Then we can think about adding stuff
  to e.forms to automatically generate a dialog. And -- scarier still --
  writing stuff back to .Xdefaults or whatever. This is probably a longer-term
  idea, though. There's a long way between our options stuff and something as
  good as Apple's. And I guess the right direction to go in is one that moves
  us away from .Xdefaults and .Xresources except as an initial land grab.
