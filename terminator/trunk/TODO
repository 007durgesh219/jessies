TODO file for the Terminator project.
This file contains all the stuff which still needs to be decided, considered or done.
If you want to take over an item, please assign it to yourself in your own section.
When adding stuff, please put a priority to its left.  Priorities range from 1-5, with
5 most important and 1 least.


Unassigned TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[5]	Particularly since we can't chmod from Java, make logging optional.
[5]	Stop inserting blank lines at the bottom when we're resized.
[5]	Implement "New Window" to go with "New Tab".
[5]	Sort out some decent way of building distributions, including the library superstar.
[5]	Find some profiling tool to see if we can find simple ways of speeding up.
[5]	Fix ^C. It works fine if you've started Terminator from another terminal emulator (xterm, say), but if you start it from the GNOME panel, it doesn't. stty -a can't see any difference.
[3]	Review the current properties reading, and see if it's really going to work well enough.  Possibly add "?MacOS:" stuff to it.
[1]	Add bracket-matching double-click selection?
[1]	Parse Mac OS Terminal.app settings. (Only if running on Mac OS?)
[1]	Implement 'mode 1'.
[1]	Feedback on other tabs when there's been output you haven't seen yet?
[1]	cursorColor should default to foreground rather than black.
[1]	Shouldn't log while in alternate buffer mode.
