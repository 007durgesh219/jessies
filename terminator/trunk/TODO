This file contains all the stuff which still needs to be decided, considered or done.

When adding stuff, please put a priority to its left.  Priorities range from 1-5, with
5 most important and 1 least.


Unassigned TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[5]     Fix backspace in vim on Linux; it deletes forwards, and is driving me mad whenever I write a checkin comment. Must start work on CheckInTool.
[5]     Fix ^C. It works fine if you've started Terminator from another terminal emulator (xterm, say), but if you start it from the GNOME panel, it doesn't. stty -a can't see any difference.
[5]	Cursor should always be visible - at the moment the cursor can disappear in inverse video.
[1]	Add bracket-matching double-click selection?
[1]	Parse Mac OS Terminal.app settings. (Only if running on Mac OS?)
[1]	Implement 'mode 1'.
[1]	Feedback on other tabs when there's been output you haven't seen yet?
[1]	cursorColor should default to foreground rather than black.
[1]	Shouldn't log while in alternate buffer mode.



Phil's TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~
[5]	Fix the line wrapping so it's useable when needed.
[5]	Get the wrapping toggle on/off to wrap/unwrap the text when triggered.



Elliott's TODOs:
~~~~~~~~~~~
[1] Add resources or other configuration file for hyperlink recognizers. Maybe allow arbitrary classes to be instantiated?
