ChangeLog for Terminator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

File started on 13th May 2004.  This is several weeks after development first started, so

	* Made memory efficiency improvements to the way tabs are stored within TextLine,

	* Fixed up the selection highlighter so it highlights only entire tabs, not bits of tabs.
