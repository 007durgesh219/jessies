	* src/e/gui/EButton.java src/e/gui/EMenu.java
	  src/e/gui/EPopupMenu.java: fix the warnings caused by a check I
	  added to jikes; "Accessing the class field "NAME" via an instance
	  is discouraged because the field accessed will be the one in the
	  variable's declared type, not the instance's dynamic type."
	  Unfortunately, this doesn't explain why we have to manually
	  fiddle with our text areas' key maps before the keyboard
	  equivalents actually work. Seems I'd already been through and
	  called the fields in question ACTION_NAME instead of NAME, and
	  passed them to the super constructor.

	* src/e/edit/OpenQuicklyDialog.java: since Java 1.5.0beta1, we've
	  been having trouble where the focus would be lost to the
	  newly-opened file when you double-click an entry in the "Open
	  Quickly" list. This would mean that your next click in the "Open
	  Quickly" dialog would be swallowed, which didn't seem right. So,
	  rather than work out how not to lose the focus (you'd think that
	  being modal would prevent our dialogs from losing the focus,
	  wouldn't you?), let's just wrestle the focus back again.

	* src/e/edit/ETextWindow.java: if we're given an address to jump to
	  that is invalid because the column offsets would give us a start
	  or end of selection that's past the end of the line, stick at the
	  end of the line instead. So we don't ignore the fact that there
	  was (or seemed to be) a column address, but we also don't wander
	  off onto completely the wrong line. Which was the previous
	  behavior.

	* edit: stop trying to second-guess the user. Use whatever 'java'
	  is first on their path. Remove the heap-size setting that
	  currently kills Java 1.5. Also on Mac OS X, use whatever the
	  user's configured as their default Java version, rather than
	  hard-coding a specific one as we've done in the past.

	  src/e/util/GuiUtilities.java: Java 1.5.0beta1's GTK+ look and
	  feel is unusable, so let's not use it, even if it would be the
	  system default.
