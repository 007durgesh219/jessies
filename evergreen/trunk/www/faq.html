<h1>Evergreen FAQ</h1>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>Why do I see warnings from Windows XP's firewall?</h2>

<p>Evergreen listens on a socket for requests to open files.
This lets you use the evergreen script to open files on your editing machine from elsewhere.
Before accepting requests on the socket, Evergreen insists that a client authenticate itself.
This uses a secret stored in ~/.e.edit.Edit/.secret.
We create that file with permissions such that it should only be readable by your user account.
For this to work, then, that path must point to the same file on both machines.
Windows XP's firewall, in its default configuration, will pop up a warning and block Evergreen from accepting connections from other machines.
If you don't want to use that facility from other machines, allowing XP to block the access would be a perfectly reasonable choice.
It will still let you connect from the local machine, which is how the feature is normally used anyway.

<h2>Where can I get Exuberant ctags?</h2>

<p>If you don't have Exuberant ctags as "exuberant-ctags", "ectags", or the first "ctags" on your path, you'll see an error message something like:
"Is Exuberant ctags installed and on your path? There was an error reading the tags: The tags file didn't have a valid header.".

<p>Cygwin doesn't install any "ctags" by default, so you'll have to install Cygwin's package.

<p>Linux users shouldn't see this problem, because the package they installed will have had a dependency on the appropriate ctags package.

<p>Mac OS still ships with an old BSD "ctags", which you need to replace or override.
You can get a pre-built Mac OS binary of <a href="../3rdParty/ctags-5.6-darwin-universal">ctags-5.6-darwin-universal</a>, or you can build your own.
Either way, you'll want to make it executable and copy it somewhere on your path, renaming it to just "ctags" (or one of the other choices mentioned above).
So something like <tt>sudo cp ctags-5.6-darwin-universal /usr/bin/ctags ; sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/ctags</tt> should work, assuming you're happy to lose the system-provided version.

<p>For Solaris users, Exuberant Ctags is available pre-packaged, via <a href="http://www.blastwave.org/">Blastwave</a>.
