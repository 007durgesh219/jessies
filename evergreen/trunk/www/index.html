<h1>Evergreen</h1>

<p><strong>Evergreen (formerly "Edit") is a GPL development environment that tries to be lightweight and language-agnostic yet functional.</strong>

<p>Evergreen started as a project to reimplement Rob Pike's <a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/acme/acme.html">acme</a> editor in Java, so I could use it on Unix and Windows.
(I'd got used to it at university, using Plan 9.)
Eventually, my editor diverged and today probably represents my personality quite closely; in particular, if the computer <i>can</i> do something, it <i>must</i>.
I certainly shouldn't have to.

<h2><a name="features">Features</a></h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ubiquitous Regular Expressions</strong> - Programmers know regular expressions, and yet their graphical tools don't use make much use of them.
Evergreen does.
Anywhere it's asking you to type something, it's probably expecting a regular expression: full Perl/Java regular expressions in find, in find/replace, in find in files (as you'd expect), but also in the open dialog.

<li><p><strong>Open Files Quicker</strong> - Evergreen indexes your project, so you don't have to remember where files are.
Or what case your co-worker used ("Hyperlink" or "HyperLink"?).
Just a substring or regular expression that matches what you want.
Evergreen updates a list of the matching files as you type (like iTunes):

<p>You can also search for files to open based on their content.

<li><p><strong>Find</strong> - You have a fast computer, yet the 'find' function in other editors doesn't take advantage of that fact.
Evergreen, like <tt>less(1)</tt>, highlights all the matches.
Better still, Evergreen does so as you type, lets you move backwards as easily as forwards through the matches, and shows you next to the scroll bar where the other matches are:

<p align="center"><img src="find.png" width="748" height="185" alt="Highlighted find matches">

<li><p><strong>Spelling Checking for Source Code</h3> - Not only does Evergreen check your spelling as you type, it understands CamelCase words aren't single-word spelling mistakes but compounds of correctly spelled words.
In this example, the identifiers have been checked too:

<p align="center"><img src="spelling.png" width="433" height="159" alt="Spelling checking of code">

<li><p><strong>Exuberant Ctags Support</strong> - Evergreen uses <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant ctags</a> (if installed) to understand the structure of your file.
You can click on a tag to go to that point in the file, and the tag corresponding to the current caret position is always highlighted.

<p>Classes, methods and fields are easily distinguished by shape; accessibility is denoted by color.
Static members are in bold.

<img src="tags-panel.png" width="197" height="120" alt="Tags support">

<li><p><strong>Bug Database Links</strong> - References to bugs in your (or others') bug databases are automatically recognized and turned into hyperlinks:

<p align="center">
<img src="bug-links.png" width="442" height="261" alt="Bug database links">

<li><p><strong>Find/Replace</strong> - Find/replace functionality in other editors has a habit of being awkward in use.
How much better to be able to see all the changes at once, with the results of the substitutions?

<p align="center"><img src="find-replace.png" width="706" height="530" alt="Find and replace">

<p>(An open question is whether we wouldn't be even more comfortable with something more like the output from <tt>diff&nbsp;-u</tt>.)

<li><p><strong>Workspaces</strong> - You can work on multiple projects at once, with each "workspace" getting its own tab in the overall UI.

<li><p><strong>Watermarks</strong> - Each document has a watermark, used to show you if you're looking at a read-only file, or a file that has been updated on disk since it was last read in.

<li><p><strong>Building</strong> - Evergreen defers to make(1) or ant(1) to actually build your project, and will search upward from the directory containing the focused file looking for a makefile.

<li><p><strong>Patches</strong> - If you choose a potentially destructive action such as "Revert to Saved", you're shown a colored patch and given a chance to change your mind.
(Not only that, it's a useful way to see how a machine-generated file is changing as you work on the generator.
Just keep running the script and reverting to the latest version of the generated file.)

<li><p><strong>"Compare Selection and Clipboard..."</strong> - Shows you a patch comparing the currently-selected text and the text on the clipboard.
This is useful when you're looking at two seemingly duplicate chunks of code and want to know what, if any, differences there are between the two.

<li><p><strong>Language awareness</strong> - Coloring and intelligent indentation of C++, Java, Perl, and Ruby.

<li><p><strong>Custom text component</strong> - We gave up on <code>JTextPane</code> because of its poor performance, and we gave up on <code>JTextArea</code> because of its poor functionality.
Unlike many other editors with their own text components, ours was explicitly designed to be useful elsewhere.
It's interface is broadly similar to <code>JTextArea</code> so it's easy to use in your own programs if you get used to any of the great functionality.

<h2>Notes on using Evergreen</h2>

<p>Workspaces are important.
You probably want one for each project you're working on.
If a workspace looks like a project (i.e. has a Makefile or is under revision control), the files will be indexed.
So you probably want the root of your workspaces to be the directories with the top-level makefiles.

<p>Evergreen will automatically help you format your code in K&amp;R, Linux kernel, or Sun's Java style.
If you want to manually break long lines or use an indenting style too far removed from these, you're likely to face difficulties as it continues to try to "correct" your style.
Ken Arnold's <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=74230">thoughts on coding style</a> explain why this is usually a counter-productive degree of freedom.
What you gain from accepting Evergreen's style (which shouldn't be a problem for most programmers) is that Evergreen will do most of the formatting for you.
Even correcting stuff you paste in.
