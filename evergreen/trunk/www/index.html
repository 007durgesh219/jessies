<h2>Why another editor?</h2>

<p>You can be forgiven for wondering why anyone would write another editor.
There are plenty out there. Surely one fits?

<p>Edit started as a project to reimplement Rob Pike's
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/acme/acme.html">acme</a>
editor in Java, so I could use it on Unix and Windows. (I'd got used
to it at university, using Plan 9.) Eventually, my editor diverged and
today probably represents my personality quite closely; in particular,
if the computer <i>can</i> do something, it <i>must</i>. I certainly
shouldn't have to.

<h2>What's so great about Edit?</h2>

<h3>Ubiquitous regular expressions</h3>

<p>Programmers know regular expressions. And yet their graphical tools
don't use make much use of them. Edit does. Anywhere it's asking you to
type something, it's probably expecting a regular expression: full Perl/Java
regular expressions in find, in find/replace, in find in files (as you'd
expect), but also in the open dialog.

<h3>The best open dialog</h3>

<p>Edit indexes your project, so you don't have to remember where files
are. Or what case your co-worker used ("Hyperlink" or "HyperLink"?). Just
a substring or regular expression that matches what you want. Edit updates
a list of the matching files as you type (like iTunes):

<h3>The best find</h3>

<p>You have a fast computer, yet the 'find' function in other editors is
grindingly slow. Edit, like <tt>less(1)</tt>, highlights all the matches.
Only Edit does it as you type, lets you move backwards as easily as
forwards through the matches, and shows you next to the scroll bar just
where the matches are:

<div align="center"><img src="find.jpg"></div>

<h3>The best find/replace</h3>

<p>Find/replace functionality in other editors
has a habit of being awkward in use. How much
better to be able to see all the changes at once, with the results of the
substitutions?

<div align="center"><img src="find-replace.jpg"></div>

<p>(An open question is whether we wouldn't be even more comfortable with
something more like the output from <tt>diff&nbsp;-u</tt>.)

<h3>The best spelling checking</h3>

<p>Not only does Edit check your spelling as you type, it understands
CamelCase words aren't single-word spelling mistakes but compounds of
correctly spelled words:

<h2>How do I install it?</h2>

<p>Good question. The distribution is here (<a href="edit.tgz">edit.tgz</a>),
but you'll also need a copy of the library to go with it (<a href="../salma-hayek/salma-hayek.tgz">salma-hayek.tgz</a>).
