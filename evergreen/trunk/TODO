Add a field to "Add Workspace" so you can specify a build host. Any build
commands are then prefixed with "ssh build-host ".

Title bar text:
 1. Don't show repository root prefix in title bars?
 2. Intelligently truncate titles too long for the title bar?

Sort windows alphabetically?

Subversion ignores the following by default; maybe we should hard-code
something similar in Evergreen?
# global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la #*# .*.rej *.rej .*~ *~ .#* .DS_Store

We should keep track of 'recent files' on a per-workspace basis. We
should also use scm's ability to find what's modified in a repository (once
it gains this ability) to be able to offer a list of modified files too.

Did you know that vim keeps a ~/.vim/backup/ directory, containing the
equivalent of our .bak files?

The completion should work for languages other than Java. We can collect
all the identifiers from the current file and sort them, at the very
least.

spelling checking:
 1. add a way to show a short list of the misspelled words in the current file. and a way to add them to an exclusion list? or find/replace them?
 2. should we be less eager? have a timer so we don't literally check as you type each character? i think what i'd really like is two alpha values: one for misspelling-in-progress that's significantly lighter than finished-misspelling (which can be the same as what we're using at the moment), or some kind of scheme where alpha increases with age?
 4. instead of dumping everything in the known-bad hash, we should only pay attention to 'misspellings' left in files when they're written. the known-bad hash contains too many spellings-in-progress.

symbolic links: given that we don't really (see FIXME in FileUtilities) recognize symbolic links properly, how about having "Add Workspace" automatically use the canonical path of whatever path you give it? though that might look ugly, and it is kind of doing exactly what someone's presumably trying to avoid by using a symbolic link: remembering a specific path that may change.

Find/Replace:
 1. Find/Replace is broken for matches that span lines. (Try a find pattern that contains "\n", for example.) [there's also a file "find-test.txt".] Martin just successfully deleted whole lines matching " *MONK\n", although the Matches and Replacements boxes were empty. The problem being that we use the Pattern.MULTILINE flag; " *MONK$" would have looked right and worked. But this isn't generally true: "a\nb" is not the same as "a$b".
 2. Some way of marking submatch groups: the whole match is marked in red or blue, but it would be good to also see the submatches within that.
 4. Should be able to select matches/replacements, and only apply the selected ones.

we've removed most uses of "new File" and FileUtilities.parseUserFriendlyName
in favor of FileUtilities.fileFromString, but should probably have something
similar in the other direction, where special JFilenameField components would
let us always show the user-friendly forms.

[ ] fix the fact that you can slide windows off the bottom of the column,
    or behind the others at the bottom of a column.

[ ] make use of the 'help' key on Apple desktop keyboards.

[ ] opening files: say "if we don't find an exact match (i.e. a longest
    common prefix that equals a workspace root), automatically create a new
    workspace with [what? the longest common prefix?] as its root". the trouble,
    as i've mentioned before, is that this doesn't do exactly what you want if
    you open an unspecific file (~/edit.properties, say) and then go to a
    more-specific file for which there's no better workspace
    (~/Projects/rarely-used-project/, say).

[ ] as a matter of interest, i accidentally opened 40 files on one workspace
    yesterday. (i don't have a tall enough display for 40 titlebars.) Evergreen
    didn't behave particularly gracefully, but it didn't spaz out in a
    damaging way. i think we should refuse to open files on a workspace if
    it's full.

[ ] http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/at/book/Windows9.html says to position
    dialogs "at the golden mean of the parent window". Centered horizontally,
    and vertically n pixels below the top of the parent, where
    
        n = parentHeight - (parentHeight/1.618)

    This only applies the first time the dialog is opened. Thereafter, it should
    re-appear where it was when it was closed.

[ ] should have an environment variable editor (like the Windows Control
    Panel one).

[ ] We could support automatic "bk edit"ing of files using this command:

        bk sfiles -v ValidDeque.h

    Which produces:

        l    SCCS/s.ValidDeque.h

    Or:

        u    SCCS/s.ValidDeque.cpp

    The letters mean:

                    l???   the file is locked
                    u???   the file is unlocked
                    jjjj   the file is junk
                    xxxx   the file is an extra
                    ?c??   the file is modified (changed)
                    ??p?   the file has pending deltas

    So "u" means that "bk edit" is necessary to edit it.

        bk sfiles -v badger

    Produces no output even when not in a bk work area.

[ ] Change the stream monitoring code to distinguish stdout from stderr;
    get the errors windows to automatically close after a build if there
    wasn't anything on stderr? Is it possible to recognize that a task's
    finished?

[ ] Open Quickly:

    [ ] kfind works something like this (though they split the choices
        between two tabs):
        
        Look in directory: [                       ][v]
        For files named:   [                       ][v]
        Containing text:   [                       ][v]

[ ] Cursor movement infelicities/bugs.

    [ ] I'd be interested in making caseChangesLikeThis count
        as word breaks. (Xcode 1.5 does this with control + arrow keys.)

[ ] I'd really like to have Evergreen format javadoc-style comments for me,
    making sure they're no more than 72 characters wide and have *s in
    the right places and so forth.

[ ] Only check for symbolic links on non-Windows OSes.

[ ] Martin says we shouldn't write to a copy then copy that over the
    original. He says to write a safe copy and then try writing into
    the original. The advantage? ACLs and Windows security descriptors
    would be preserved.
    
    One trick, is in being able to recognize that you've successfully
    written a copy of the file. How do you know it's actually made it?
    Even if you read it back, how do you know that's not coming from
    some local cache?
    
    The original reason for this TODO entry was to prevent symlinks
    from being replaced by the new copy of the file they refer to.
    Canonicalization of filenames has provided a certainly adequate
    and probably superior solution to that part of the problem.

    The real problem with the create-write-rename approach is that it
    doesn't work on Win32.

[ ] The code for correcting indentation could be smarter. It doesn't do
    well with any of the things mentioned below.
    
    [ ] Over-complicated expressions. If we have unbalanced parentheses,
        we should probably indent as far as the last unclosed parenthesis.
        This can lead to right-justified code, mind, but then what are
        people doing writing stuff like this?

        x = (some & (initial << expression)) | (this() * that() +
                                                the_other() - 1);

[ ] SCM: (BitKeeper for me, CVS for Ed)

    3. remove current file
        bk rm $filename

    4. rename current file
        bk mv $filename $new-filename

    http://bk-emacs.bkbits.net/

[ ] grep " *" * in a directory with a reasonable amount of stuff in it.
    Watch Evergreen have some kind of spazzy fit. how can we cure this? Pike's
    sam (and acme?) would redirect a command's output to a file, then show
    the first n lines of that file, giving you the option to see more.
    maybe we shouldn't auto-scroll? maybe we should block until the user
    hits a key, sort of permanent 'pager' mode? maybe we need a second
    level of buffering over the current get-a-line-or-a-few-hundred-
    milliseconds-worth scheme, so that if we don't get a natural break,
    we wait until we do. what i think i mean is that getting a newline
    shouldn't flush. we should get (say) 16KiB or timeout. only in these
    cases should we flush.

[ ] Update the manual!

[ ] Have a way to copy a file or rename a file.

[ ] Make the arrow keys move through 4-space tabs? If backspace knows
    about indent.string, shouldn't delete?

[ ] Need to be able to go quickly from a #include to a header file.

[ ] Handle out-of-date files better

    If we kept a copy of the file's contents last time we knew we were clean, we could also provide diffs to the common ancestor.  Experience merging changes with BitKeeper shows that this isn't often useful but it's sometimes very useful.
    
    If we had that, we could notice that the file on disk was touched but its contents didn't change.  This would help me avoid spurious out-of-date watermarks with my bk edit setup.

HELP/DOCUMENTATION

+ consider using Python and PyGtk and MozEmbed to use a native browser component rather than Java.

+ add some way of getting a list of the documentation providers, and where they're looking, and whether they've disabled themselves for lack of data, and how you (the user) would fix that (for systems where we can't make our package install the extras automatically).

+ use CSS to improve TABLE appearance. (see STL documentation.)

+ set always on top? (an OpenWindows-like pin icon would be nice for this.)

+ documentation browser back button should have Firefox-like history pop-down.

+ documentation browser address bar.

+ documentation browser progress bar.

+ documentation browser's title should change depending on the page we're showing, putting the specific first, like Firefox: "isdigit(3) - Evergreen Documentation Browser". 

+ Insert Missing #includes (control-#)

  automatic pulling of #include files from man page for function at cursor:

   helium:/$ man 2 kill 2> /dev/null | grep '#include' | sort | uniq 
       #include <signal.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>

  avoid pulling in #includes from EXAMPLES or whatever (see strftime for such
  a man page). that is: only accept matches in the SYNOPSIS section.

  could also do import statements for Java.

+ in JavaDoc.urlExists, cache successes.

+ also Mac documentation:
   root at: /Developer/ADC Reference Library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/
   under there: (Foundation|ApplicationKit|WebKit)/ObjC_classic/Classes/$word.html
   also: (Foundation|ApplicationKit|WebKit)/Classes/$word_Class/index.html 

+ better assembler documentation. Mac OS has "EM64T Help.app", "IA32 Help.app", and "PowerPC Help.app", which are basically just the Intel/Motorola PDFs with a machine-readable index and a little browser. we could make use of these on Mac OS or, better still, roll our own. likewise JVM bytecodes from the Sun JVM specification. one interesting problem is recognizing what kind of assembler we're dealing with.

+ also Perl documentation: use perldoc(1) for packages as well as functions. man page researcher should include "3pm" man pages in Perl context.

+ base conversion advisor will have to become a tool tip to remain useful, i think. 

+ should JavaDoc link to real pages in a real web browser, or try to extract the relevant chunk? (i don't think Swing's HTML code is up to the job of showing full JavaDoc pages.)

+ Java: a visual distinction between methods from this interface and methods from superinterfaces would be useful.

+ Java: we should get rid of my compressed rendering of signatures now we've got more room. it could be quite useful to be able to copy & paste the signatures into code.

+ cope with "man:" (et cetera) in the "address bar".

+ could have a combo box to choose man page sections. (any parallels for other documentation types?)

EXTERNAL TOOLS

+ ExternalTools should also let you specify which languages they apply to. 

PREFERENCES

+ default encoding, default line ending (per language/per workspace?).

+ overriding of environment variables?

+ setting of regular expressions for excluded files, et cetera. text label explaining about the scripts we'll try to call to provide further customization.

SAVING/RESTORING STATE

MODELINES

+ parse emacs/vim modelines.

+ the indentation guesser should look for "indent" modelines. it should also cope better with "4-spaces but use leading tabs where possible".

+ support this Emacs mechanism for letting an individual source file record how to build itself? is there an equivalent for how to run/test the program?

/*
Local Variables:
compile-command: "gcc -DSOMETHING -I../include -g -Wall test.cpp"
End:
*/

+ support this BBEdit mechanism for arbitrary counterparts (and maybe #line too?):

  -*- x-counterpart: file; -*-

OPENING

+ it would be nice to be able to open "~/wlog-lad.txt" more conveniently.

+ it would be super-nice to be able to browse the file system at least as well as from Windows' "Run..." dialog.

SAVING

+ auto-save to ".bak", on timer. 

+ if the encoding is changed, we should check that the document can still be encoded; and prevent entering unencodable characters? ... maybe the right decision is to check on save instead. SubEtherEdit has a little dialog showing the problems:

http://codingmonkeys.de/blog/articles/2006/09/19/new-features-in-subethaedit-2-5

SELECTION

+ Edit > Select > Word (ctrl-W) / Line (shift-command-L) / Paragraph / Enclosing Brackets (shift-command-B) / Current Scope (ctrl-alt-B) / All (command-A) 

+ show "natural" line count in status bar when partial lines are selected.

VIEW

+ Show Line Numbers - should probably apply to the whole editor, and persist. (alt-command-L) 

+ Show Invisibles (alt-command-I) could show newlines and spaces. tabs we already show anyway.

+ Kate, BBEdit, SubEthaEdit, and others are all implementing the "indent wrapped lines" idea we never got round to.

TEXT

+ Text > Convert > to Uppercase (ctrl-U) / to Lowercase (ctrl-shift-U) / to Titlecase (ctrl-alt-U) / to Opposite Case (ctrl-G). work on selection or word at caret? or just character before caret? 

+ Text > Convert > Spaces to Tabs / Tabs to Spaces

+ Text > Sort (selection/whole document)

+ Text > Remove Duplicate Lines (like uniq(1), or without the requirement that the input be sorted?) 

+ Text > Shift Left (command-[) / Shift Right (command-]) add or remove one level of indentation

+ Text > Execute Line Inserting Result (control-R; actually inserts '\n' first) / Filter Through Command... (alt-command-R) 

+ Evaluate Line / Selection (control-command-C), evaluate mathematical expression; could do arbitrary Java/Ruby.

NAVIGATION

+ Navigation > Add/Remove Bookmark (toggles on command-F2) / Next Bookmark (F2) / Previous Bookmark (shift-F2) --- handy for getting back to where you were if you need to go off and search for something.

+ Remove search field from tags panel, and add an action that pops up a filtering-list dialog.

SEARCH

+ use PatternSyntaxException's stored index to highlight regular expression errors in the text field showing them. JTextField does support highlighters.

LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC COLORING/INDENTATION

+ see if we can learn anything from /usr/share/gtksourceview-1.0/language-specs

+ should color regular expression literals, heredocs, and (same thing) Python multi-line comments.

+ textmate uses (http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Perl.tmbundle/Syntaxes/Perl.plist) this for heredocs in Perl:
   <string>((&lt;&lt;) *"([^"]*)").*\n?</string>
   <string>(^\3$)</string>

+ textmate has these test cases:

$sql .= <<SQL if ( $type eq 'cnd' or $type eq 'mul' );
LEFT JOIN features AS d6 ON a.Style = d6.UID
SQL

$Q->{foo1} ||= $DBH->prepare(<<EOQ);
pretend this is SQL
EOQ

$Q->{foo2} ||= $DBH->prepare(<<EOQ);
The next heredoc
EOQ

+ textmate also has warnings for anyone trying to do Ruby.

+ need coloring and indentation for:
  + CSS
  + PL/SQL

+ need indentation support for:
  + assembler
  + HTML (i.e. XML)
  + makefile
  + perl (currently uses C-family support)
  + vhdl
  + XML

+ kate uses (http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/cvs-api/kdelibs-apidocs/kate/html/classKateVarIndent.html):

- var-indent-indent-after: a regular expression pattern, if the first line with content above the current, indentation is added 
- var-indent-indent: a regular expression pattern, if the current line matches indent is added. this is not tested if the above matched. 
- var-indent-unindent: a regular expression pattern, if it matches the current line, indent is removed. 
- var-indent-triggerchars: a string of characters, when any is typed, the current line is reindented. 

 bash:
  var-indent-indent-after (\\{(?![^\\}]*\\})|\b(then|elif|else)\b(?!.+fi)\\bdo\b(?!.+done)|\\bcase\\s+\\s+in\\b(?!.*esac)|\\[\\[)
  var-indent-indent \\$\\{.*\\}
  var-indent-unindent (\\}|\\b(fi|elif|else)\\b|\\bdone\b|\\besac\\b|\\]\\])
  var-indent-triggerchars {}
 perl:
  var-indent-indent-after (?:\\{(?![^}]*\\})|\\((?![^\)]*\\)))
  var-indent-indent (?:\\{.*\\}|\\(.*\\))
  var-indent-unindent [})]
  var-indent-triggerchars })
 ruby:
  var-indent-indent-after ^( )*(if|while|def|class|for).*|\\{[^\\}]*$|else|elsif|rescue|do|begin
  var-indent-indent
  var-indent-unindent end|else|elsif|rescue|^[^\\{]*\\}
  var-indent-triggerchars }def

LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC TOOLS 

+ HTML: send to validator.w3.org/check (control-command-V); also CSS validator.

+ Perl: perltidy(1).

+ C: support indent(1) if we see a ".indent.pro" file in one of the looked-for places. (or in the workspace root?) just offer to run indent(1)? or run it automatically? (on save? show a patch or just make the change, like for terminal newlines?)

+ Java: rewriting the indenter stuff, i could really have used a simple tool to show me the inheritance hierarchy of the indenter classes.

+ for reference: GEdit plug-ins.

UNDO

+ why do we sometimes claim the document is dirty, yet revert says "no non-whitespace changes"?

STRANGE FILE SUPPORT

+ we could automatically gunzip/gzip .gz files.

+ we could automatically convert binary plist files to/from xml.

+ we could have some kind of helper program to help us handle authentication to read/write files we wouldn't otherwise have access to.

OS INTEGRATION

+ more GNOME icons: as well as the menu icons, we should have the same icon for the "OK" button in the corresponding dialogs.

+ we should be a top-level drag and drop target:

   http://weblogs.java.net/blog/shan_man/archive/2006/09/toplevel_drop_w.html

+ avoid GNOME focus-stealing-prevention. currently breaks command-line "Evergreen" use, auto-completion, and probably other stuff.

+ for reference: Visual Studio key bindings: http://xona.com/2005/08/02a.html

BUILDING

+ neilb suggests having the whole command in the "Set Build Target" dialog. defaulting to what we normally construct. empty string automatically replaced? or a "reset to default" button?

+ possibly also add a "test" command to go with the "build" command. 

+ maybe all in a Workspace > Properties dialog, along with the title and directory (currently in "Edit Workspace")?

+ lose the errors window and open a new window for each build started. warn if the user tries to start two builds in the same workspace (but allow them to override), or possibly just warn if they start two builds from the same root (or overlapping roots)?
