TODO list for Edit

Subversion ignores the following by default; maybe we should hard-code
something similar in Edit? I'd like to remove more of edit.properties,
and at least only have it contain differences from some sensible default
state, rather than be strictly necessary for a working Edit.
# global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la #*# .*.rej *.rej .*~ *~ .#* .DS_Store

We should keep track of 'recent files' on a per-workspace basis. We
should also use scm's ability to find what's modified in a repository (once
it gains this ability) to be able to offer a list of modified files too.

If we open (via the system open dialog or our 'vi' script) a file that
isn't in the workspace file list but is under the workspace root, it should
be added to the list.

Thinking about the literal string/regular expression problem I just
fixed with FindFilesContainingSelectionAction, we should have a text
field capable of automatically coloring invalid regular expressions
red, and offering an explanation for any status line that happens to
be available. Or we should fix all the existing dialogs using normal
text fields to be like the Find/Replace dialog, which is the one
place we do this properly at the moment.

Did you know that vim keeps a ~/.vim/backup/ directory, containing the
equivalent of our .bak files?

The completion should work for languages other than Java. We can collect
all the identifiers from the current file and sort them, at the very
least.

We could use the completion code's list of unique identifiers to prime
the exceptions dictionary for spelling checking. No more balking at
words like "Highlighter", that are in the JDK but not in ispell's
dictionary.

Java 1.5:
 1. use Thread.getAllStackTraces to let us type C-\ at the UI to see what
    it's doing. can this work? or is it most likely to be useful when the
    event handling thread's too busy? maybe what we want is to implement
    some kind of Pure Java sampling profiler. you could turn that on
    before the expensive operation, and check its findings afterwards.
    wouldn't help with kind of problem that exhibits itself as a random
    pause, but it would help with more general slowness.

advisor:
 1. call researchers in a different thread.

find in files:
 1. don't search twice for the same thing. we're not that fast!
 3. show the matching line(s).
 7. if the 'files containing' field is blank at the start of the search, there's no need to do a full search; the result should be the same as a search for files matching 'whose names match'.
 8. sometimes (not always) i see the list of matches get populated, and then everything vanishes at the last moment. i seem to remember the open quickly dialog used to do that too, but stopped doing it some time ago. it seems particularly prone to it if the list of matches is long.

spelling checking:
 1. add a way to show a short list of the misspelled words in the current file. and a way to add them to an exclusion list? or find/replace them?
 2. should we be less eager? have a timer so we don't literally check as you type each character? i think what i'd really like is two alpha values: one for misspelling-in-progress that's significantly lighter than finished-misspelling (which can be the same as what we're using at the moment), or some kind of scheme where alpha increases with age?
 3. is there a bug with misspellings at end-of-file?
 4. instead of dumping everything in the known-bad hash, we should only pay attention to 'misspellings' left in files when they're written. the known-bad hash contains too many spellings-in-progress.

symbolic links: given that we don't really (see FIXME in FileUtilities) recognize symbolic links properly, how about having "Add Workspace" automatically use the canonical path of whatever path you give it? though that might look ugly, and it is kind of doing exactly what someone's presumably trying to avoid by using a symbolic link: remembering a specific path that may change.

Find/Replace:
 1. Find/Replace is broken for matches that span lines. (Try a find pattern that contains "\n", for example.) [there's also a file "find-test.txt".] Martin just successfully deleted whole lines matching " *MONK\n", although the Matches and Replacements boxes were empty. The problem being that we use the Pattern.MULTILINE flag; " *MONK$" would have looked right and worked. But this isn't generally true: "a\nb" is not the same as "a$b".
 2. Some way of marking submatch groups: the whole match is marked in red or blue, but it would be good to also see the submatches within that.
 4. Should be able to select matches/replacements, and only apply the selected ones.

[ ] if you want the documentation for startsWith, you have to know it's
    in String and either find "String" and double-click it or find the advisor
    text field and type "String", and then you have to navigate the
    HTML documentation manually to find String.startsWith.
    How big would a database of all JDK methods be?

use Position instead of an int and arithmetic to re-position the caret
after an editing operation. it's clearer, and we seem to keep getting
the arithmetic wrong.

we've removed most uses of "new File" and FileUtilities.parseUserFriendlyName
in favor of FileUtilities.fileFromString, but should probably have something
similar in the other direction, where special JFilenameField components would
let us always show the user-friendly forms.

[ ] auto-scroll in the errors window shouldn't stop immediately we output
    a link: it should ensure that the first link we output doesn't scroll
    off the top --- that's the behavior we're trying to ensure. we can
    hack this by recording the link's rectangle and doing a scrollRectToVisible
    for it each time we've done a scrollRectToVisible for a new line (which
    strikes me as likely to be rather annoying jumpy behavior), or we can
    work out how to compare these rectangles and currently-visible rectangle
    (which i assume we can get hold of) and decide on that basis whether to
    scrollRectToVisible.

[ ] fix the fact that you can slide windows off the bottom of the column,
    or behind the others at the bottom of a column.

[ ] Store divider position on quit. Restore on start.

[ ] make use of the 'help' key on Apple desktop keyboards.

[ ] opening files: say "if we don't find an exact match (i.e. a longest
    common prefix that equals a workspace root), automatically create a new
    workspace with [what? the longest common prefix?] as its root". the trouble,
    as i've mentioned before, is that this doesn't do exactly what you want if
    you open an unspecific file (~/edit.properties, say) and then go to a
    more-specific file for which there's no better workspace
    (~/Projects/rarely-used-project/, say).

[ ] as a matter of interest, i accidentally opened 40 files on one workspace
    yesterday. (i don't have a tall enough display for 40 titlebars.) Edit
    didn't behave particularly gracefully, but it didn't spaz out in a
    damaging way. i think we should refuse to open files on a workspace if
    it's full.

[ ] http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/at/book/Windows9.html says to position
    dialogs "at the golden mean of the parent window". Centered horizontally,
    and vertically n pixels below the top of the parent, where
    
        n = parentHeight - (parentHeight/1.618)

    This only applies the first time the dialog is opened. Thereafter, it should
    re-appear where it was when it was closed.

[ ] when we warn that a file's changed, we should try harder to see if
    it really has. BitKeeper has a habit of touching files without modifying
    them.

[ ] auto-indent should only apply to source files, not text files.

[ ] find out (using jdb?) where the OutOfMemoryException is thrown if
    you load a huge file, and plug the leak. then we could optimistically
    try to load huge files and fail gracefully. (catching the exception in
    the right place, we could also present an appropriate error to the
    user.)

auto-saving

    [ ] Store divider position on quit. Restore on start.

    [ ] we start up with the same files that were open when we quit, but we
        don't remember how much space each had (or what order they were in),
        which detracts somewhat.

[ ] should have an environment variable editor (like the Windows Control
    Panel one).

[ ] upon performing 'new file', and including a non-existent directory as
    part of the new filename, the directory should be created too, i think.
    perhaps with a 'you've either mistyped that, or you want a new
    directory as well, don't you?' kind of message.  

[ ] We could support automatic "bk edit"ing of files using this command:

        bk sfiles -v ValidDeque.h

    Which produces:

        l    SCCS/s.ValidDeque.h

    Or:

        u    SCCS/s.ValidDeque.cpp

    The letters mean:

                    l???   the file is locked
                    u???   the file is unlocked
                    jjjj   the file is junk
                    xxxx   the file is an extra
                    ?c??   the file is modified (changed)
                    ??p?   the file has pending deltas

    So "u" means that "bk edit" is necessary to edit it.

        bk sfiles -v badger

    Produces no output even when not in a bk work area.

[ ] hungry delete should probably delete to the correct indentation position
    for the line first. so

    if (blah) {
            something();
    }

    with the caret before the 's' of 'something' would first delete four
    spaces to fix the indentation, and then, if you backspace again, delete
    back up to the opening brace.

[ ] How about an imitation of Chimera/Safari's download manager windows
    to show what tasks we've got running? Although Ant makes it quite
    clear when it's finished, it's not nearly as obvious with grep or
    even plain old make. Sometimes I carry on with other work too early,
    other times I wait too long.

    [ ] Change the stream monitoring code to distinguish stdout from stderr;
        get the errors windows to automatically close after a build if there
        wasn't anything on stderr? Is it possible to recognize that a task's
        finished?

    [ ] Is "Build Project" a special case that deserves a dialog with some
        kind of progress feedback? Or do we want a 'Task Manager' dialog that
        deals with everything? Is ant a special case of "Build Project" (since
        it gives us clear feedback as to what phase of a build it's in, unlike
        make).

[ ] Open Quickly:

    [ ] kfind works something like this (though they split the choices
        between two tabs):
        
        Look in directory: [                       ][v]
        For files named:   [                       ][v]
        Containing text:   [                       ][v]

[ ] Cursor movement infelicities/bugs.

    [ ] I'd be interested in making caseChangesLikeThis count
        as word breaks.

    [ ] Mac OS X and Windows: 'Up' should go to the start of the document
        if on the first line, not stay still (worked in 1.3.1, but Sun
        broke it for 1.4 and haven't fixed it yet).

[ ] I'd really like to have Edit format javadoc-style comments for me,
    making sure they're no more than 72 characters wide and have *s in
    the right places and so forth.

[ ] Only check for symbolic links on non-Windows OSes.

[ ] Martin says we shouldn't write to a copy then copy that over the
    original. He says to write a safe copy and then try writing into
    the original. The advantage? ACLs and Windows security descriptors
    would be preserved.
    
    One trick, is in being able to recognize that you've successfully
    written a copy of the file. How do you know it's actually made it?
    Even if you read it back, how do you know that's not coming from
    some local cache?
    
    The original reason for this TODO entry was to prevent symlinks
    from being replaced by the new copy of the file they refer to.
    Canonicalization of filenames has provided a certainly adequate
    and probably superior solution to that part of the problem.

[ ] Finish the tags support.

    [ ] Like Ed says, we should probably have some kind of timer that
        makes sure we keep the tags up-to-date as we edit (because the
        focus won't be changing while we're making edits). My current
        feeling is that what we probably want is a timer that's (re)started
        each time a newline is entered (because only line changes are
        significant?) and which causes a tags scan if it fires.

[ ] Something like iCal's/Outlook's to-do list. Keep a pair of files at
    the root of a workspace: TODO and TODONE, say. Complete a task and
    (when you quit? after a fixed interval?) it moves to TODONE.

    [ ] emacs has a ChangeLog command to add a ChangeLog entry. We might
        want to offer something similar.

[ ] The code for correcting indentation could be smarter. It doesn't do
    well with any of the things mentioned below.
    
    [ ] C switch statements.

        switch (x) {
            case 1:
                f();
                break;
            default:
                g();
                break;
        }

        (It does okay if you're prepared to use braces around the bodies
        of the individual cases. This is a workaround I've taken to using,
        when I find myself writing -- to my shame -- switch statements.)

    [ ] C++ ostream output, where broken lines typically align at "<<".

        std::cout << "hello, "
                  << "world!" << std::endl;

    [ ] Over-complicated expressions. If we have unbalanced parentheses,
        we should probably indent as far as the last unclosed parenthesis.
        This can lead to right-justified code, mind, but then what are
        people doing writing stuff like this?

        x = (some & (initial << expression)) | (this() * that() +
                                                the_other() - 1);

[ ] SCM: (BitKeeper for me, CVS for Ed)

    1. diff current file against repository
        bk diffs -u $filename [display in some funky way]

    2. revert changes in current file
        bk unedit $filename
        bk get $filename

    3. remove current file
        bk rm $filename

    4. rename current file
        bk mv $filename $new-filename

    5. (bk-specific, or generalizable?) 'check in and commit, potentially
       adding new files, removing uncommitted files, or reverting modified
       files'
        bk citool

    http://bk-emacs.bkbits.net/

[ ] grep " *" * in a directory with a reasonable amount of stuff in it.
    Watch Edit have some kind of spazzy fit. how can we cure this? Pike's
    sam (and acme?) would redirect a command's output to a file, then show
    the first n lines of that file, giving you the option to see more.
    maybe we shouldn't auto-scroll? maybe we should block until the user
    hits a key, sort of permanent 'pager' mode? maybe we need a second
    level of buffering over the current get-a-line-or-a-few-hundred-
    milliseconds-worth scheme, so that if we don't get a natural break,
    we wait until we do. what i think i mean is that getting a newline
    shouldn't flush. we should get (say) 16KiB or timeout. only in these
    cases should we flush.

[ ] Update the manual!

[ ] Fix double-clicking next to a " character to be as it was before.

[ ] Have a way to copy a file or rename a file.

[ ] Make the arrow keys move through 4-space tabs? If backspace knows
    about indent.string, shouldn't delete?

[ ] Add some kind of "template" facility to "New File" to automatically fill
    in the boilerplate. A combo box or list in the 'new' dialog would do,
    letting us choose a named sample from the files in $EDIT_HOME/templates
    or some-such. This is basically what Project Builder does (it has a
    directory for each type).
    
[ ] Need to be able to go quickly from a #include to a header file.

[ ] wily-style access to |, > and < commands?
