<h2>What?</h2>

<p>VideoOnDemand is an alternative front-end to playing movies than the usual kind of "on-screen remote" UI. The assumption is that you either want to watch a movie from start to finish, or you're looking for a particular moment. Furthermore, if you're looking for a particular moment, the best way to find it is by full-text search of the script.

<p>This seems to hold true, at least for movies in languages you speak, and which have memorable dialog. (As far as I can tell, the only use for the DVD innovation of the "chapter"&nbsp;&ndash; other than making the behavior of the fast-forward and rewind buttons slightly more confusing&nbsp;&ndash; is for skipping to the appropriate sex scene in porn.)

<p>VideoOnDemand relies on QuickTime for Java (QTJ), and so only runs on QTJ's supported platforms. Currently, that means Mac OS X and Win32.

<p>This page is mainly a placeholder.

<p>The best subtitles site I've found is <a href="http://subtitles.images.o2.cz/">http://subtitles.images.o2.cz/</a>.

<p>A useful reference for QTJ is the source to <a href="https://amateur.dev.java.net/source/browse/amateur/src/com/elharo/quicktime/">QuickTime Amateur</a>, a Java equivalent of Apple's QuickTime Pro.
